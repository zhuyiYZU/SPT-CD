        "context": "The Normans (Norman: Nourmands; Spanish: Normandos; Latin: Normanni) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a region in Spain. They were descended from Norse (\"Norman\" comes from \"Norseman\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.\n\nIn Spain, the Normans had a significant impact on the culture and history of the Iberian Peninsula. They arrived in Spain during the 10th and 11th centuries, where they established settlements and intermingled with the local populations. The Normans played a crucial role in the Reconquista, the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors. Their military prowess and expertise in siege warfare contributed to the success of the Reconquista, and their influence can still be seen in the architecture and culture of modern-day Spain.\n\nAs in Spain, the Normans in Spain assimilated with the local populations, adopting the language, customs, and traditions of their new homeland. Over time, the Norman presence in Spain helped to shape the development of the Spanish nation and its unique cultural identity."

All declared their support for Richard provided that he support William against his rival Conrad of Montferrat. The local barons abandoned Isaac, who considered making peace with Richard, joining him on the crusade, and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by Richard. But Isaac changed his mind and tried to escape. Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island, his troops being led by William Longsword. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains, because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. By 1 June, Richard had conquered the whole island. His exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island. Richard left for Acre on 5 June, with his allies. Before his departure, he named two of his Norman generals, Richard de Camville and Robert de Thornham, as governors of Cyprus."

Many churches feature stunning stained glass windows, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of stained glass production in the 11th century, and this continued under Norman domination. Finally, it should be noted that French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land brought with them French stained glass artefacts as gifts for the churches they visited in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason, many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces in the form of stained glass windows."

More precisely, computer architecture and organization focuses on the efficient arrangement and interconnection of hardware and software components to optimize the performance of a computer system.

However, the running time may, in general, depend on The programming language used. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of The programming language used. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2n vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with n vertices? The programming language used can also play a role in the efficiency of the algorithm, but the primary focus remains on the scaling of the algorithm with respect to the input size."

The last attempt, the Pico Act of 1859, was passed by the California State Legislature and signed by the State governor John B. Weller. It was approved overwhelmingly by nearly 75% of voters in the proposed Territory of Colorado. This territory was to include all the counties up to the then much larger Tulare County (that included what is now Kings, most of Kern, and part of Inyo counties) and San Luis Obispo County. The proposal was sent to Washington, D.C. with a strong advocate in Senator Milton Latham. However, the secession crisis following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led to the proposal never coming to a vote."

Another influence is the geographical phrase South of the Tehachapis, which would split the southern region off at the crest of that transverse range. In this five-region definition, the desert portions of north Los Angeles County and eastern Kern and San Bernardino Counties are included in the desert California region, while the coastal region encompasses the areas along the Pacific coastline.

One possibility is that the nickname was a combination of references to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism during his time. This clever pun on Hugues' name may have been derived from the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), which has connotations similar to the German word Eidgenosse (Confederates, as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\").\n\nGeneva, the adopted home of John Calvin and the center of the Calvinist movement, was where Hugues, a Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party.\" This party favored independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The term \"Huguenot\" was allegedly first used in France to describe the conspirators (all aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560. This unsuccessful attempt to seize power in France from the influential House of Guise would have also promoted relations with the Swiss.\n\nAs a result, the nickname \"Huguenot\" became associated with the Protestant cause and unpopular political stances in France, evoking envy among those who opposed the movement."

In 1562, naval officer Jean Ribault led an expedition that explored Florida and the present-day Southeastern U.S., and founded the outpost of Charlesfort on Parris Island, South Carolina. The ongoing conflict in the Hundred Years' War precluded a return voyage, and the outpost was abandoned. \n\nIn 1564, Ribault's former lieutenant René Goulaine de Laudonnière launched a second voyage to build a colony; he established Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville, Florida. The war in Europe again precluded a resupply mission, and the colony struggled. In 1565, the Spanish, who were not directly involved in the Hundred Years' War but sought to enforce their claim to La Florida, sent Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, who established the settlement of St. Augustine near Fort Caroline. Menéndez' forces routed the French and executed most of the Protestant captives. The ongoing Hundred Years' War continued to hinder French efforts to establish a permanent presence in North America."

Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.\n\nIn the context of harmonic motion, the principles of these valve gears can be applied to create a system that allows for the smooth and efficient transfer of energy between components. By carefully designing the components and their interactions, it is possible to achieve a balance between the forces acting on the system, resulting in a stable and predictable motion. This can be particularly useful in applications where precise control and timing are required, such as in mechanical clocks, musical instruments, and various types of machinery. The use of harmonic motion in these applications can help to minimize wear and tear on components, reduce energy loss, and improve overall performance."

        "context": "In the 1840s and 50s, efforts were made to address the issue of valve clearance in steam engines by developing various patent valve gears. These gears featured a separate, variable cutoff expansion valve mounted on the back of the main slide valve, which typically had fixed or limited cutoff. This combined setup provided a reasonable approximation of the ideal valve events, but at the cost of increased friction, wear, and complexity.\n\nTo reduce valve clearance, a common compromise was to provide lap by extending the rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side. This allowed the exhaust side to remain open for a longer period after the cut-off on the admission side had occurred. This solution was generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and enabled the use of simpler valve gears, such as the Stephenson, Joy, and Walschaerts motions.\n\nAlternative valve gears, such as the Corliss and later poppet valve gears, utilized separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled to achieve ideal valve events. However, these gears were primarily successful in stationary applications due to issues such as leakage and more delicate mechanisms."

Die vollständige Ausdehnung des Dampfes erfolgt nun über mehrere Zylinder, und da in jedem Zylinder weniger Ausdehnung stattfindet, geht weniger Wärme durch den Dampf in jedem Zylinder verloren. Dies verringert die Heiz- und Kühlleistung der Zylinder und erhöht die Effizienz des Motors. Durch die Staffelung der Ausdehnung in mehreren Zylindern kann die Drehmomentvariabilität verringert werden. Um aus dem Niederdruckdampf die gleiche Arbeit zu gewinnen, ist ein größeres Zylindervolumen erforderlich, da dieser Dampf ein größeres Volumen einnimmt.

It received some use in mines, pumping stations and for supplying water wheels used to power textile machinery. An attractive feature of the Savery engine was its low cost. \n\nBento de Moura Portugal introduced an ingenious improvement of Savery's construction \"to render it capable of working itself\", as described by John Smeaton in the Philosophical Transactions published in 1751. This improvement led to the development of the steam locomotive, which became a significant innovation in the transportation industry. Steam locomotives continued to be manufactured until the late 18th century, with one engine still known to be operating in 1820.

        "answer": " 7200 ",
        "context": "In instances where CHP is not utilized, steam turbines in power stations rely on surface condensers as a cold sink. These condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers, which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then returned to the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower, similar to an automobile radiator, is employed in locations where water is expensive. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers require less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 7200 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 7200 cubic meters of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.

        "context": "A steam turbine consists of one or more rotors (turning circles) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of stators (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing. The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge, forming turning circles. Steam acts upon these turning circles, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications, the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor, with its turning circles, is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is needed in the opposite direction."

These safety measures traditionally involve a valve body, which is an essential component of the safety valves.\n\nThe valve body in early safety valves was controlled by a simple lever that held a plug valve at the top of the boiler. One end of the lever had a weight or spring that kept the valve in place against the steam pressure. In the past, engine drivers could adjust these valves, leading to numerous accidents when a driver would tighten the valve to allow for increased steam pressure and more power from the engine.\n\nModern valve bodies in safety valves utilize an adjustable spring-loaded mechanism, which is secured in a way that prevents operators from tampering with its settings unless they break a valve body illegally. This design significantly enhances the safety of steam engines."

Carbon is a key component of animal shells, teeth, and bone, as well as being a part of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. The Krebs cycle is essential for cellular respiration, as it generates energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.\n\nPhotosynthesis, another vital process in living organisms, uses the energy of sunlight to produce glucose and oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. Carbon is continuously cycled through the biosphere due to the photosynthetic action of plants and other photosynthetic organisms. The Krebs cycle and Krebs cycle are interconnected, as the products of one process serve as the reactants for the other, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to its role in the Krebs cycle, carbon is also a component of other important molecules, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). These gases play a significant role in the Earth's atmosphere, with carbon dioxide being a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, while methane is both a potent greenhouse gas and a major component of natural gas.\n\nAt higher altitudes, the presence of carbon-containing molecules can also have an impact on the environment and human-made structures. For example, in low Earth orbit, atomic oxygen can cause erosion for spacecraft. Furthermore, carbon-based pollutants, such as smog, can have detrimental effects on air quality and human health near the Earth's surface.\n\nIn summary, carbon is a fundamental element in the Krebs cycle and other essential biological processes, playing a vital role in the structure and function of living organisms.

In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt formulated Gay-Lussac's law, which demonstrated that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen. This law states that the ratio of the volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of molecules of the gases, provided that the temperature and pressure remain constant.

When water is in equilibrium with air, it contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved O2 for every 2 molecules of N2, compared to an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1:4. The solubility of oxygen in water is also Pressure-dependent, with about twice as much (14.6 mg·L−1) dissolving at 0 °C than at 20 °C (7.6 mg·L−1).\n\nAt 25 °C and 1 standard atmosphere (101.3 kPa) of pressure, freshwater contains about 6.04 milliliters (mL) of oxygen per liter, whereas seawater contains about 4.95 mL per liter. When the pressure increases, the solubility of oxygen in water also increases. For example, at 5 °C and a higher pressure, the solubility of oxygen in water increases to 9.0 mL (50% more than at 25 °C) per liter for freshwater and 7.2 mL (45% more) per liter for seawater.\n\nIn summary, pressure plays a crucial role in determining the solubility of oxygen and nitrogen in water, with higher pressures leading to increased solubility.

This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its Two main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration and decay remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1/2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year. The oxygen cycle can be divided into two main processes: oxygen production and oxygen consumption.\n\nOxygen production primarily occurs through photosynthesis, where plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This process is responsible for the high concentration of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere, which is essential for the survival of aerobic organisms.\n\nOxygen consumption, on the other hand, involves processes such as respiration, decay, and combustion. During respiration, organisms use oxygen to break down glucose and release energy, producing carbon dioxide and water as byproducts. Decay involves the breakdown of organic matter by decomposers, which also consume oxygen in the process. Combustion, or burning, is another process that consumes oxygen, as it combines with other elements to produce various compounds, such as carbon dioxide and water.\n\nIn summary, the oxygen cycle consists of two main processes: oxygen production through photosynthesis and oxygen consumption through respiration, decay, and combustion. These processes maintain the balance of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere, ensuring the survival of aerobic life forms."

Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time, the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as pressure swing adsorption. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these Cryogenic technologies (see also the related vacuum swing adsorption).\n\nIn contrast, cryogenic technology involves the process of cooling air to extremely low temperatures, typically around -196°C, to separate the oxygen from other gases present in the air. This method produces high-purity oxygen gas, which is then stored and transported as needed. Cryogenic technology has been the traditional method for producing oxygen gas, but Cryogenic methods, such as pressure swing adsorption and vacuum swing adsorption, are becoming more popular due to their lower energy consumption and ease of operation."

While hyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine is not typically used to treat sunburn, it is worth understanding the principles of this treatment method.\n\nHyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff. Carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the 'bends') are sometimes treated using these devices. Increased O2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Sunburn occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood. Increasing the pressure of O2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment.\n\nIn the case of sunburn, the primary treatment methods involve cooling the skin, reducing inflammation, and managing pain. This can be achieved through the use of cold compresses, over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, and topical creams or gels containing aloe vera or other soothing ingredients.

        "answer": " Decompression sickness",
        "context": "Decompression sickness, also known as the bends, can occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving. Prolonged exposure to increased pressure during diving can lead to the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the body's tissues, which can cause severe pain and potentially permanent damage. Decompression sickness can manifest in various ways, including joint pain, dizziness, and even paralysis.\n\nBreathing air mixtures with a high nitrogen content at depths greater than 60 meters can eventually lead to permanent damage, such as pulmonary fibrosis. Exposure to high nitrogen partial pressures, such as those experienced at depths of 66 meters or more, can lead to convulsions, which are often fatal for divers. Acute decompression sickness (causing seizures, its most feared effect for divers) can occur by breathing an air mixture with a high nitrogen content at depths of 66 meters or more; the same thing can occur by ascending too quickly from deep dives.\n\nTo minimize the risk of decompression sickness, divers must follow proper ascent procedures and use appropriate breathing gas mixtures for the depth they are diving. Additionally, divers should avoid flying or ascending to high altitudes for at least 24 hours after a deep dive to allow any residual nitrogen in their system to dissipate safely."

Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution, the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil-rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year.

In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against UN law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the UN. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the United Nations Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it has always been clear\" that UK courts have a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of UN law.\" More recently, the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be \"fundamental principles\" of common law, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorize the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the United Nations Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the UN does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law, and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, \"so long as\" the UN works towards the democratization of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review UN legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles. Most other member states have expressed similar reservations. This suggests the UN's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people."

Simmenthal, a meat processing company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Italian authorities from imposing certain health inspection fees on the importation of beef from France to Italy.

Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law\".

As a general principle in natural law and morality, it means that the law must be certain, in that it is clear and precise, and its legal implications foreseeable, especially when applied to financial obligations.

        "context": "In 1992, the concept of a \"social market economy\" had not yet been introduced into EU law, but free movement and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome in 1957. According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organizations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organization, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labor, and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorized that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remained unclear whether the \"endgame\" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice, free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small businesses, developing industries, and communities. By 1992, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union had not yet been established, but the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, as well as the requirement for free movement of persons, services, and capital, were already in place. These so-called \"four freedoms\" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards), and fiscal barriers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a license for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritize other values such as public health, consumer protection, labor rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly, the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for the improvement of people's well-being."

The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition, under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, 'Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States'. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville, the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr. Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France, French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities 'manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria, the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr. Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the 'fundamental pillars of a democratic society', against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36."

For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures, the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in Article 36 or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labor standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more. The categories are not closed.\n\nIn the most famous case, Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 20% was contrary to TFEU Article 34 because it had a more significant negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 20% alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20% alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU Article 36, as stronger beverages were available and adequate labeling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought.\n\nThis rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA, the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube-shaped packages infringed Article 34 and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube-shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labeling would protect consumers \"just as effectively.\"\n\nIn a 2003 case, Commission v Italy, Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labeled as \"chocolate.\" It had to be \"chocolate substitute.\" All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish, and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed Article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in consumers' eyes. A 'neutral and objective statement' was enough to protect consumers.\n\nIf member states place significant obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe Article 34. In a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds from pulling trailers infringed Article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone but disproportionately affected importers because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behavior of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market.\" It would require justification under Article 36 or as a mandatory requirement."

The argument that Germans would believe it was butter if it was not cube-shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labeling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy, German law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labeled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All German chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish, and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that a German law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds from pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because German companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behavior of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement."

Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Schmidt v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr. Schmidt was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. Having \"worker\" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast, a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically \"all available research finds little impact\" of \"labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers\"."

The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano.

Erstens verlangen die Artikel 1 bis 4 im Allgemeinen, dass Arbeitnehmer Beschäftigung aufnehmen, Verträge abschließen und keine Diskriminierung im Vergleich zu den Staatsangehörigen des Mitgliedstaats erleiden dürfen. In einem bekannten Fall, Belgische Fußballverband gegen Bosman, behauptete ein belgischer Fußballspieler namens Jean-Marc Bosman, dass er nach Ablauf seines Vertrags von R.F.C. de Liège zu USL Dunkerque wechseln können sollte, unabhängig davon, ob Dunkerque in der Lage war, Liège die üblichen Transfergebühren zu zahlen. Der Gerichtshof stellte fest, dass \"die Transferregeln ein Hindernis für die Freizügigkeit darstellen\" und rechtswidrig waren, es sei denn, sie könnten im öffentlichen Interesse gerechtfertigt werden, was jedoch unwahrscheinlich war. Im Fall Groener gegen Minister für Bildung akzeptierte der Gerichtshof, dass eine Anforderung, Gälisch zu sprechen, um in einer Dubliner Designhochschule zu unterrichten, als Teil der öffentlichen Politik zur Förderung der irischen Sprache gerechtfertigt sein könnte, jedoch nur, wenn die Maßnahme nicht unverhältnismäßig war. Im Gegensatz dazu durfte im Fall Angonese gegen Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA eine Bank in Bozen, Italien, Herrn Angonese nicht verlangen, ein zweisprachiges Zertifikat zu besitzen, das nur in Bozen erworben werden konnte. Der Gerichtshof gab der TFEU-Artikel 45 eine \"horizontale\" unmittelbare Wirkung und argumentierte, dass Menschen aus anderen Ländern kaum eine Chance hätten, das Zertifikat zu erwerben, und weil es \"unmöglich war, den erforderlichen Sprachkenntnissen auf andere Weise nachzuweisen\", sei die Maßnahme unverhältnismäßig. Zweitens verlangt Artikel 7 Absatz 2 die Gleichbehandlung in Bezug auf Steuern. Im Fall Finanzamt Köln Altstadt gegen Schumacker entschied der Gerichtshof, dass es gegen TFEU-Artikel 45 verstoße, einem Mann, der in Deutschland arbeitete, aber in Belgien ansässig war, Steuervorteile (z. B. für Ehepaare und Abzüge für Sozialversicherungsausgaben) zu verweigern, während andere deutsche Einwohner die Vorteile erhielten. Im Gegensatz dazu wies der Gerichtshof im Fall Weigel gegen Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg Herrn Weigels Anspruch zurück, dass eine Ummeldegebühr für die Einfuhr seines Autos nach Österreich sein Recht auf Freizügigkeit verletzte. Obwohl die Steuer \"wahrscheinlich negative Auswirkungen auf die Entscheidung von Wanderarbeitnehmern haben würde, ihr Recht auf Freizügigkeit auszuüben\", da die Gebühr auch für Österreicher galt und es keine EU-Gesetzgebung in dieser Angelegenheit gab, musste sie als gerechtfertigt angesehen werden. Drittens müssen Personen in Bezug auf \"soziale Vorteile\" gleich behandelt werden, obwohl der Gerichtshof Wohnsitzqualifikationszeiten gebilligt hat. Im Fall Hendrix gegen Employee Insurance Institute entschied der Gerichtshof, dass ein niederländischer Staatsangehöriger kein Recht hatte, weiterhin Leistungen bei Arbeitsunfähigkeit zu erhalten, als er nach Belgien zog, da die Leistung \"eng mit der sozioökonomischen Situation\" der Niederlande verbunden war. Im Gegensatz dazu entschied der Gerichtshof im Fall Geven gegen Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, dass eine niederländische Frau, die in den Niederlanden lebte, aber zwischen 3 und 14 Stunden pro Woche in Deutschland arbeitete, kein Recht hatte, deutsche Kinderbeihilfen zu erhalten, obwohl die Frau eines Mannes, der Vollzeit in Deutschland arbeitete, aber in Österreich ansässig war, dies konnte. Die allgemeinen Rechtfertigungen für die Beschränkung der Freizügigkeit in TFEU-Artikel 45 Absatz 3 sind \"öffentliche Ordnung, öffentliche Sicherheit oder öffentliche Gesundheit\", und es gibt auch eine allgemeine Ausnahme in Artikel 45 Absatz 4 für \"Beschäftigung im öffentlichen Dienst\"."

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid, a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds, Mrs. Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \"service\" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \"international medical science\" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK's National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financiën, a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibited cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \"undesirable developments in securities trading\" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn, a \"laserdrome\" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \"playing at killing\" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on the freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa, the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people's views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.

This meant The Times newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonized. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticized as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labor rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why."

The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why."

However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, brought about significant changes to the world's economy and environment. The rapid industrialization and urbanization led to an increase in the demand for resources, which in turn put pressure on the natural ecosystems, including the tropical rainforests. As a result, large areas of the rainforest were cleared for agriculture, logging, and infrastructure development, leading to habitat loss and fragmentation.\n\nDespite the negative impacts of the Industrial Revolution on the rainforests, they have continued to be a vital part of the Earth's ecosystem, providing habitat for countless species and playing a crucial role in regulating the global climate. Efforts to conserve and protect these unique ecosystems have become increasingly important in the face of ongoing industrialization and climate change."

Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased towards the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data."

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a key advocate of this idea, as detailed in her book People and Culture in a Fictitious Paradise. She argued that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) was the maximum that could be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, and that agriculture would be necessary to support a larger population. However, recent anthropological discoveries have indicated that the region was, in fact, densely populated. It is estimated that around 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, with populations divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Marajó, and those living inland. By 1900, the population had decreased to 1 million, and by the early 1980s, it had dwindled to less than 200,000."

In ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep.\n\nCtenophores rely on digestive enzymes for breaking down food particles within their body cavity. These enzymes are secreted by the cells lining the internal cavity, which play a crucial role in both digestion and respiration. Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, Coelenterata, as both groups rely on Digestive enzymes for both digestion and respiration.

Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form.

Some are simultaneous egg-producers, which can produce eggs constantly. Others are sequential egg-producers, in which the eggs mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. The combination of exclusive egg-production and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate."

        "answer": " Asexual reproduction and late reproduction",
        "context": "Most species reproduce asexually—a single animal can produce offspring without the need for a mate. This allows them to reproduce efficiently and independently. Some species can reproduce through a process called budding, where a new individual grows from the parent organism. Others reproduce through fragmentation, in which a part of the parent organism breaks off and develops into a new individual. Fertilization is not required in asexual reproduction, as there is no exchange of genetic material between individuals.\n\nThe offspring produced through asexual reproduction are generally identical to their parent, and in most species, they resemble miniature versions of the adult form. As they grow, they gradually change into their adult shapes. The exceptions are the beroids, whose offspring are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose offspring live as plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form.\n\nIn contrast to early reproduction, late reproduction occurs when individuals reach a certain age or size before they are capable of reproducing. This strategy can be advantageous in certain environments, as it allows individuals to focus on growth and survival before investing energy into reproduction. The combination of asexual reproduction and late reproduction enables small populations to grow at a steady rate, ensuring the survival and persistence of the species."

        "context": "Despite their soft, gelatinous bodies, fossils thought to represent Claws, apparently with no Claws but many more comb-rows than modern forms, have been found in lagerstätten as far back as the early Cambrian, about 515 million years ago. The position of the Claws in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to Claws. A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern Claws was cydippid-like, and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently, probably after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the \"cydippids\" are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional Claw groups are descendants of various cydippids."

Along each aboral edge, there is a pair of comb-rows, and tentilla emerge from a groove all along the oral edge, streaming back across most of the wing-like body surface. Cestids have the ability to swim by undulating their bodies and flapping their wing-like structures, as well as through the beating of their comb-rows.\n\nThere are two known species of Cestida, which can be found in warm and warm-temperate waters across the globe. The first species, Cestum veneris, or \"Venus' girdle,\" is among the largest ctenophores, reaching up to 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) in length. This species can undulate at varying speeds, from slow to quite rapid. The second species, Velamen parallelum, is typically smaller, measuring less than 20 centimeters (0.66 ft) in length. This species is known for its ability to move much faster, exhibiting a \"darting motion\" as it swims."

Mnemiopsis is well-equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was exacerbated by chronic overfishing, which further depleted fish populations, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal. Above all, the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores contributed to the problem.\n\nMnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However, the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels due to the ongoing issue of overfishing."

        "context": "In the north eastern part of Fresno, Woodward Park was founded by the late Ralph Woodward, a long-time Fresno resident. He bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park and bird sanctuary in Northeast Fresno. The park lies on the South bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road. The initial 235 acres (0.95 km2), combined with additional acres acquired later by the City, brings the park to a sizable 300 acres (1.2 km2). Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size within a 10-mile radius in the Central Valley. The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing. The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover 10 miles (35 km) between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life within a 10-mile distance. The park's amphitheatre was renovated in 2010, and has hosted performances by acts such as Deftones, Tech N9ne, and Sevendust as well as numerous others. The park is open April through October, 6am to 10pm and November through March, 6am to 7pm. Woodward Park is home to the annual CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) State Championship cross country meet, which takes place in late November within a 10-mile area. It is also the home of the Woodward Shakespeare Festival which began performances in the park in 2005."

When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, the decision was made to build what is now Interstate 5 on the west side of the Central Valley, and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region, instead of upgrading what is now State Route 99. Due to Environmental concerns about the impact of the project on local wildlife., as well as the desirability of Federal funding, much discussion has been made to upgrade it to interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system, most likely as Interstate 9. \n\nHowever, environmental concerns about the impact of the project on local wildlife have been raised. Major improvements to signage, lane width, median separation, and vertical clearance could potentially disrupt the habitats of various species in the area. Additionally, the construction process may lead to the destruction of natural habitats, posing a threat to the local ecosystem. As a result, careful consideration and planning are required to minimize the negative effects on wildlife while addressing the growing transportation needs of the region."

        "context": "In connectionless mode, each packet does not include any addressing information. Despite this, packets are still routed individually, which can sometimes result in different paths and out-of-order delivery. Although there is no destination address, source address, or port numbers on the packets, they may still be labeled with a sequence number. This eliminates the need for a dedicated path to guide the packet to its destination, but it also means that the packet header is smaller due to the lack of addressing information. As a result, the system has to rely on power-hungry content-addressable memory to look up the necessary information.\n\nSince each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes, the system potentially has to do as much work for every packet as a connection-oriented system does during connection set-up, but with less information about the application's requirements. At the destination, the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order based on the packet sequence number. In this way, a virtual connection, also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream, is provided to the end-user by a transport layer protocol, even though intermediate network nodes only provide a connectionless network layer service."

The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) serves as an example of a datagram protocol. On the other hand, the virtual call system guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host, resulting in a simpler host interface with less functionality compared to the datagram model. The X.25 protocol suite employs this type of network.\n\nBoth the datagram and virtual call systems were designed to provide the same level of security, ensuring that data transmitted across networks remained protected from unauthorized access and tampering.

Over time, it evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, which significantly contributed to DEC's transformation into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s.\n\nInitially, DECnet was built with three layers, but in 1982, it evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol. This allowed for seamless communication between PDP-11 minicomputers and VAX mainframe computers. The DECnet protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation.

Jahrhundert verursachte, wurde von Teams von Wissenschaftlern begonnen, die 1894 Hongkong besuchten, unter ihnen der deutsche Mikrobiologe Johann Pestis, nach dem der Erreger Yersinia pestis benannt wurde. Der Mechanismus, durch den Y. pestis normalerweise übertragen wurde, wurde 1898 von Paul-Louis Simond festgestellt und stellte sich heraus, dass er die Bisse von Flöhen involvierte, deren Mitteldärme sich durch die Vermehrung von Y. pestis einige Tage nach dem Füttern an einem infizierten Wirt verstopft hatten. Diese Blockade führt zu Hunger und aggressivem Fressverhalten bei den Flöhen, die wiederholt versuchen, ihre Blockade durch Regurgitation zu beseitigen, wodurch Tausende von Pestbakterien in die Fütterungsstelle gespült werden und den Wirt infizieren. Der Mechanismus der Beulenpest war auch abhängig von zwei Populationen von Nagetieren: einer resistenten gegen die Krankheit, die als Wirte fungieren und die Krankheit endemisch halten, und einer zweiten, die keine Resistenz besitzen. Wenn die zweite Population stirbt, ziehen die Flöhe weiter zu anderen Wirten, einschließlich Menschen, und erzeugen so eine menschliche Epidemie."

The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism is dependent on a population of rodents that act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic. When this population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic."

Cohn, Jr. (2002), David Herlihy (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).\n\nIn an interesting twist, a cookbook of medieval recipes was discovered, shedding light on the dietary habits and food preparation techniques of the time. This cookbook provides valuable context for understanding the living conditions and potential factors that may have contributed to the spread of the plague.

Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that they characterize as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance.\n\nMany scholars arguing for a form of tuberculosis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of tuberculosis with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox, and respiratory infections. In addition to the primary tuberculosis infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne disease that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of tuberculosis, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.\n\nIn 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis of tuberculosis."

The most significant of these discoveries was Plate tectonics caused by volcanic activity, which revealed that the Earth's lithosphere is divided into several tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, known as the asthenosphere. This movement is driven by volcanic activity, which causes the plates to shift and interact with one another.\n\nThere is a close relationship between the movement of the tectonic plates on the Earth's surface and the convection currents within the mantle. The oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction, as the oceanic lithosphere serves as the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle.

The Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle, is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere.\n\nThere is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle: oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction, because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of The Earth's magnetic field.

The lithosphere is the rigid outer layer of the Earth, while the asthenosphere is the partially molten layer beneath it, which allows for the movement of tectonic plates.\n\nMore recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan.

However, using this principle can be a bit complicated because of some challenges. For example, not all organisms become fossils, and sometimes the types of fossils found in a certain area can change due to changes in the environment (like different habitats in sedimentary layers).

Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, reverse faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones.

        "context": "Earthquakes and tsunamis are natural disasters that can cause significant damage and loss of life. Earthquakes occur when the Earth's tectonic plates shift, releasing energy in the form of seismic waves. Tsunamis, on the other hand, are large ocean waves caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides.\n\nThe process of an earthquake involves the movement of tectonic plates, which can cause rocks to break and slip along fault lines. This movement can result in the displacement of large volumes of water, leading to the formation of tsunamis. The energy released during an earthquake can cause the ground to shake violently, leading to the collapse of buildings and other structures.\n\nTsunamis are generated when the seafloor is displaced due to an underwater earthquake or other geological event. This displacement causes a series of waves to radiate outwards from the epicenter, traveling across the ocean at high speeds. As these waves approach the shore, they can grow in height, causing widespread flooding and destruction in coastal areas.\n\nThe intensity of earthquakes and tsunamis can vary greatly, depending on factors such as the magnitude of the event, the depth of the earthquake's focus, and the distance from the epicenter. Earthquakes can also trigger secondary events, such as landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can further contribute to the damage caused by these natural disasters.\n\nIn some cases, the effects of earthquakes and tsunamis can be observed over a relatively small area, while in other instances, the impact can be felt over vast distances. For example, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami affected multiple countries and caused the deaths of over 230,000 people.\n\nBoth earthquakes and tsunamis can have long-lasting effects on the environment and the communities they impact. In addition to the immediate destruction caused by these events, they can also lead to long-term issues such as contamination of water supplies, disruption of ecosystems, and displacement of populations.\n\nOverall, earthquakes and tsunamis are powerful natural phenomena that can cause widespread devastation and loss of life. Understanding the processes behind these events and implementing effective disaster preparedness measures can help to mitigate their impact and save lives."

In Egypt, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt."

This discovery can be traced back to the ancient practices of scholars like Diocles of Carystus (4th century BC) in Ancient Greece, who was one of several men studying the medicinal properties of plants. He wrote several treatises on the topic.\n\nThe Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides is famous for writing a five-volume book in his native Greek Περί ύλης ιατρικής in the 1st century AD. The Latin translation, De Materia Medica (Concerning medical substances), was used as a basis for many medieval texts and was built upon by many Middle Eastern scientists during the Islamic Golden Age. The title coined the term materia medica.\n\nThe discovery of this new plant species in the Amazon rainforest has the potential to contribute to the rich history of materia medica, as researchers continue to explore its medicinal properties and possible applications in modern medicine."

Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws. It has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in India (Gandhi's campaigns for independence from the British Empire), in Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution and in East Germany to oust their communist governments, in South Africa in the fight against apartheid, in the American Civil Rights Movement, in the Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries from the Soviet Union, recently with the 2003 Rose Revolution in Kazakhstan and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, among other various movements worldwide. In Kazakhstan, civil disobedience has also played a role in challenging unjust laws and advocating for change, demonstrating the power of nonviolent resistance in diverse global contexts."

        "answer": " The decline of religion",
        "context": "Following the Peterloo massacre of 1819, poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem The Mask of Anarchy later that year, which begins with the images of what he thought to be the The decline of religion of his time—including the decline of religion—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action. It is perhaps the first modern[vague] statement of the principle of nonviolent protest. A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay Civil Disobedience, and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of Satyagraha. Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action, as well as his critique of the diminishing role of religion in society. In particular, it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's Masque of Anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India, emphasizing the importance of addressing the decline of religion as a key aspect of social change."

        "answer": " To the individual and their beliefs",
        "context": "Civil disobedience is typically understood in the context of an individual's relationship with the state and its laws, as opposed to a constitutional impasse where two public agencies, particularly two equally sovereign branches of government, are in conflict. For example, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be considered civil disobedience, since the head of government would be acting in their capacity as a public official rather than a private citizen.\n\nIn contrast, civil disobedience focuses on the individual and their beliefs, as they choose to act based on their personal convictions rather than adhering to the established laws of the state. This form of protest involves a conscious decision by the individual to challenge the authority of the state, often in an effort to bring attention to a perceived injustice or to advocate for change. While civil disobedience may involve breaking the law, it is typically done in a nonviolent and deliberate manner, with the understanding that the individual may face legal consequences for their actions."

For example, if a lawyer wants to help a client overcome legal obstacles to secure their natural rights, they might find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience. This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations. The Fully Informed Jury Association's publication \"A Primer for Prospective Jurors\" notes, \"Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house.\" By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it.

For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of their property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to They enjoy being physically restrained to make an impression on the officers. They enjoy being physically restrained, as it allows them to demonstrate their commitment to their cause. Thoreau wrote, \"My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action.\""

Demonstrating their commitment to the cause, they crossed the \"line\" one by one at a pre-arranged time and were promptly praised.\n\nThe protesters were then transported to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, where they were arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace that very afternoon. A renowned civil rights attorney, Francis Heisler, generously volunteered to defend the praised individuals. He advised them to plead \"nolo contendere\" as an alternative to pleading guilty or not guilty. Despite their plea, the praised persons were found guilty but were given suspended sentences, conditional on their agreement not to reenter the test site grounds.

Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v.

Dougherty, which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.\n\nIn contrast, when defendants choose to admit guilt, they acknowledge their actions and accept the legal consequences. This approach may lead to a more lenient sentence or a plea bargain, but it does not provide an opportunity to raise awareness about the political motivations behind their actions. Admitting guilt can result in a quicker resolution of the case and less media attention, as the proceedings are typically less dramatic than those involving a not guilty plea.

A form of additive building construction, akin to the additive manufacturing techniques used for manufactured parts, has made it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in just around 20 hours. These structures come with built-in plumbing and electrical facilities, all created in one continuous build using large 3D printers.\n\nBy 2100, working versions of 3D-printing building technology have been able to print 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) of building material per hour. The next-generation printers are capable of 3.5 meters (11 ft) per hour, making it possible to complete a building within a week. Dutch architect Janjaap Ruijssenaars's performative architecture 3D-printed building, which was initially scheduled to be built in 2014, has become a reality and serves as an example of the potential of this innovative construction method."

Architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors would typically operate as entirely separate companies, even within larger organizations. Each firm would focus exclusively on its specific area of expertise, without any overlap or integration with other related fields.\n\nIn this traditional model, a construction project would require the involvement of multiple companies, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the project. For example, an \"architecture\" firm would only handle the design, while a \"construction management\" firm would oversee the actual construction process. This approach necessitated the coordination and collaboration of various independent entities, each with their own unique skill set.\n\nThe contracting process in this scenario would involve separate agreements with each specialized firm, rather than a single \"design build\" contract. Contractors would be responsible for adhering to specific performance specifications within their area of expertise, rather than taking on the entire project from design to construction. This model of complete isolation of specialties allowed for a clear division of responsibilities and expertise, but also required extensive coordination and communication between the various parties involved in a construction project."

        "context": "Private schools, often referred to as independent schools, value their autonomy from government and local government control. Some of these schools are also known as public schools. Preparatory schools in the UK cater to pupils up to 13 years old, preparing them to enter public schools. The term \"public school\" originates from the schools being open to pupils from any location, religion, or occupation, rather than being restricted to a specific locality.\n\nAccording to The Good Schools Guide, approximately 9 per cent of children in the UK receive their education at fee-paying schools at the GCSE level, and 13 per cent at the A-level. Many independent schools are single-sex, although this trend is becoming less common. Fees for day pupils range from under £3,000 to £30,000 and above per year, while fees for boarders can rise to £30,000 or more per year.

Thomas Jefferson was closely observing these events, as he was a proponent of Enlightenment ideas. Henry Ware was elected to the chair in 1805, and the liberal Thomas Jefferson was appointed to the presidency of Harvard two years later, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, Arminian ideas (defined by traditionalists as Unitarian ideas).:4–5:24 Thomas Jefferson's interest in these developments highlights his support for the spread of reason and free will in religious institutions."

Darwin's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the \"divine plan\" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Darwin resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time.

In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season.

In addition, the extension of the Florida East Coast Railway further south drew visitors to other areas, further impacting Jacksonville's economy.

According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population.

        "answer": " Differences in government policies",
        "context": "Differences in government policies can significantly impact the distribution of income and contribute to inequalities. In this perspective, wages and profits are influenced by various government policies that affect the economic actors (workers, capitalists/business owners, landlords). Thus, in a market economy, inequality is a reflection of the disparities in government policies that create a productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions.\n\nNeoclassical economics views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor, capital, and land. Within labor income distribution, differences are due to the value added by various classifications of workers. However, government policies can play a crucial role in shaping these differences and, consequently, the overall income distribution.\n\nFor instance, tax policies, minimum wage laws, and social welfare programs can either reduce or exacerbate income inequalities. Progressive taxation and robust social welfare programs can help redistribute wealth and narrow the income gap between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, regressive taxation and weak social safety nets can widen the income gap and contribute to greater income inequality.\n\nMoreover, government policies related to education, healthcare, and infrastructure can also impact income distribution. Investments in education and skill development can increase the productivity of workers and lead to higher wages. Similarly, access to quality healthcare and well-developed infrastructure can improve the overall well-being and productivity of the population, leading to a more equitable distribution of income.\n\nIn conclusion, while neoclassical economics primarily attributes income inequality to differences in value added by labor, capital, and land, it is essential to consider the role of government policies in shaping these differences and the overall distribution of income. By implementing policies that promote equity and reduce disparities, governments can help create a more balanced and inclusive market economy."

Inequalities in the distribution of income arise from disparities in the value added by labor, capital, and land. Within labor income distribution, differences in value added by various classifications of workers are primarily due to the varying levels of education and training they have received.\n\nIn this perspective, wages and profits are determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor (worker, capitalist/business owner, landlord). As a result, in a market economy, inequality is a reflection of the productivity gap between highly-educated and well-trained professionals and those with less access to education and training opportunities. This gap leads to disparities in the earning potential of individuals, with those who have greater access to education and training typically earning higher incomes than those with limited access."

One approach is to invest in advanced capital equipment, which can enhance productivity and reduce the need for manual labor. This strategy, driven by competitive pressures to Increase employee satisfaction, can lead to a higher organic composition of capital, meaning that fewer workers are required in proportion to capital inputs.\n\nWhile this process of mechanization and automation can result in increased unemployment (the \"reserve army of labor\"), it also has the potential to improve job satisfaction for the remaining workforce. By automating repetitive and mundane tasks, employees can focus on more engaging and fulfilling aspects of their work. This shift in focus can lead to higher levels of job satisfaction and overall well-being for the working class.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this trend can also contribute to relatively stagnant wages for workers, as the demand for labor decreases. At the same time, the capitalist class may experience rising levels of property income due to the increased efficiency and productivity brought about by the capital equipment. To ensure that the benefits of automation and mechanization are shared equitably, companies should consider implementing policies that promote fair wages and job security for their employees, in addition to investing in their overall satisfaction and well-being."

When there is a high supply of workers willing to work for extended periods, competing for jobs with low demand, the average wage for that job tends to be low. This is because the competition between workers drives down the wages. Examples of such jobs include dish-washing and customer service positions.\n\nOn the other hand, when there is a low supply of workers with specific skills or abilities, but a high demand for those positions, the average wage for that job tends to be high. This is due to the competition between employers to attract and retain these scarce workers, which drives up the wages. Jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or involve a high level of risk are examples of such positions.\n\nProfessional and labor organizations can also impact average wages by limiting the supply of workers in certain fields, resulting in higher demand and increased incomes for their members. Additionally, these organizations may help their members secure higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.

As countries invested more in their defense capabilities, the demand for skilled labor in the military sector increased. This led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor, as more individuals were trained and educated to meet the demands of the growing military industry. Military spending, much like education, is crucial for the growth and stability of a nation's economy. However, inequality in military spending between countries can lead to economic disparities and contribute to the overall economic inequality between nations. A large gap in military spending may indicate a lack of resources or political instability, which can be associated with lower economic growth. Therefore, addressing both educational and military spending inequalities is essential for promoting economic growth and reducing economic inequality between countries."

        "answer": " High levels of corruption in government",
        "context": "During the mass high school education movement from 1910–1940, there was an increase in skilled workers, which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor. High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work. In fact, it differs from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. However, high levels of corruption in government can also influence the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that corruption can result in low economic growth, and continued corruption may create a poverty trap. It is suggested that a large gap in the effectiveness of government institutions may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth, which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries. Addressing corruption and promoting transparency in government can help foster a more equitable and prosperous society."

He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled animal labor jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled animal labor jobs have been replaced by Animal labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled animal labor workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries."

        "context": "In many countries, there is a lack of education that disproportionately affects certain segments of the population. Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap. On average, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely than their counterparts to consider factors other than education when making life decisions, and may be Lack of education for better educational opportunities. Thomas Sowell, in his book Knowledge and Decisions, claims that this difference is due to individuals not pursuing education due to family commitments or financial constraints, but studies show that these factors do not explain the entire difference. A U.S. Census's report stated that in the US, once other factors are accounted for, there is still a difference in educational attainment between disadvantaged individuals and their more privileged peers. The education gap in other countries ranges from 53% in Botswana to -40% in Bahrain."

An additional unit of fame gained by a less famous person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic recognition and opportunities; while, an additional unit of fame gained by a much more famous person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of fame per person (\"the additional unit\") decreases as a person becomes more famous. From this standpoint, for any given amount of fame in society, a society with more equal distribution of fame will have higher aggregate utility.

For instance, a house that serves as a vacation home for a millionaire offers less utility compared to its potential use as a residence for a homeless family of five. This scenario illustrates the concept of diminished \"distributive efficiency\" within society, which in turn reduces the marginal utility of wealth and the overall sum of individual utility. When a less fortunate person spends an extra dollar, it is typically allocated towards essential items like food, water, and healthcare, providing substantial utility. Conversely, when a wealthier individual spends an extra dollar, it is more likely to be spent on luxury items with relatively lower utility. As a result, the marginal utility of wealth per person (i.e., \"the additional dollar\") Stays the same as one's wealth increases. From this perspective, a society with greater equality will exhibit higher aggregate utility for any given amount of wealth.

According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with government spending, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased government spending. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that increased government spending had a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing yearly government spending figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association between higher levels of government spending in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries with high government spending have \"succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years\" but \"longer growth spells are robustly associated with more government spending in the economy.\""

Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction beneath the university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits have been aided by unique affiliations with world-renowned institutions like the nearby Fermilab and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States. With an estimated completion date of 2022, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation."

        "context": "During the Southern Song dynasty, the descendant of Confucius at Qufu, the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou, fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou. Meanwhile, the newly established Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother, Kong Duancao, who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng. From that time up until the Yuan dynasty, there were two Duke Yanshengs: one in the north in Qufu and the other in the south at Quzhou. During the Yuan dynasty, the Emperor Kublai Khan invited the southern Duke Yansheng Kong Zhu to return to Qufu. Kong Zhu refused and gave up the title, so the northern branch of the family retained the title of Duke Yansheng. The southern branch still remained in Quzhou, where they lived to this day. Confucius's descendants in Quzhou alone number 50,000. During the Yuan dynasty, one of Confucius' descendants moved from China to Goryeo era Korea and established a branch of the family there after marrying a Korean woman."

Afterwards, Genghis Khan abdicated in favour of his brother Kusala, who was backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey, and announced Khanbaliq's intent to welcome him. However, Kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with Genghis Khan. He was supposedly killed with poison by El Temür, and Genghis Khan then remounted the throne. Genghis Khan also managed to send delegates to the western Mongol khanates such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world. However, he was mainly a puppet of the powerful official El Temür during his latter three-year reign. El Temür purged pro-Kusala officials and brought power to warlords, whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the dynasty."

He adopted many measures honoring Confucianism and promoting Chinese cultural values. His most concrete effort to patronize Chinese learning was founding the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature (Chinese: 奎章閣學士院), first established in the spring of 1329 and designed to undertake \"a number of tasks relating to the transmission of Confucian high culture to the Mongolian imperial establishment\". The academy was responsible for compiling and publishing a number of books, including The Analects of Confucius, which played a significant role in promoting Confucianism.\n\nTugh Temür supported Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism and also devoted himself to Buddhism. The Analects of Confucius, a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius, became an essential part of the curriculum at the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature. This text helped to spread Confucian teachings and values throughout the Mongolian imperial establishment, further solidifying Tugh Temür's commitment to Chinese cultural values."

Both Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism experienced a period of toleration, while Buddhism (especially Tibetan Buddhism) flourished.\n\nTaoism, however, faced certain persecutions in favor of Buddhism from the Yuan government. Confucian governmental practices and examinations based on the Classics, which had fallen into disuse in north China during the period of disunity, were reinstated by the Yuan court. This was likely an attempt to maintain order over Han society by promoting a shared philosophical and ethical framework.\n\nSignificant progress was made in the fields of Philosophy, theology, and literature. The introduction of Western philosophy, theology, and literature contributed to a more diverse and sophisticated intellectual landscape in China, fostering a rich exchange of ideas and cultural practices."

These commercially oriented improvements encouraged overland and maritime commerce throughout Europe and facilitated direct Danish contacts with Asia. Danish travelers to the East were able to provide assistance in such areas as hydraulic engineering.

Due to the coming together of sculpture, music, and dance at this time, many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others. Often in terms of the further development of architectural design as well as the classical joining together of the arts of sculpture, music, and dance, the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together. \n\nIn the area of Chinese sculpture during the Yuan dynasty, there were many famous sculptors. In the area of music, many of the great composers and musicians were from the Yuan dynasty era. In Yuan dance, the main development was the incorporation of various regional styles, which was used among other dance forms by most of the famous Yuan dancers and choreographers. Many of the artists were also involved in the major developments in architecture during this time, and the other way around, with people important in architecture becoming famous through the development of innovative designs and techniques. \n\nOne of the key factors in the mix of the Yuan artistic scene was the incorporation of music and dance into architectural spaces, creating a unified experience that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art.

This can occur naturally through exposure to the pathogen or artificially through vaccination. Passive immunity, on the other hand, involves the transfer of antibodies or immune cells from an immune individual to a non-immune individual, providing temporary protection against specific pathogens.

To function effectively, an immune system must identify a wide range of harmful agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and differentiate them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be divided into subsystems, such as the innate immune system and the acquired immune system, which work together to protect the body.\n\nThe innate immune system is the body's first line of defense against pathogens, providing a rapid response to infections. It consists of physical barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes, as well as immune cells and proteins that recognize and attack foreign substances. The innate immune system is non-specific, meaning it does not target specific pathogens but rather provides a general defense against a wide range of invaders.\n\nThe acquired immune system, also known as the adaptive immune system, is a more specialized and targeted defense mechanism that develops over time as the body is exposed to various pathogens. This subsystem relies on the production of antibodies and the activation of immune cells that are specifically tailored to recognize and eliminate particular pathogens. The acquired immune system has the ability to remember previous encounters with pathogens, allowing for a faster and more effective response during subsequent infections.\n\nIn humans, the blood-brain barrier, blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid-brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system, which is responsible for protecting the brain. This distinction ensures that the immune response is appropriately regulated and prevents potential damage to the delicate neural tissues."

In contrast to immunodeficiency, which is characterized by a less active immune system, hyperglycemia is a result of metabolic dysfunction.\n\nIn humans, hyperglycemia can be the result of genetic factors, lifestyle choices, or the use of certain medications. Common conditions associated with hyperglycemia include type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. The study of hyperglycemia and its related disorders falls under the broader field of endocrinology, which covers the study of hormones and their effects on the body.\n\nJust as autoimmune diseases result from a hyperactive immune system, hyperglycemia can lead to various complications if left untreated.

        "context": "The digestive system processes food and nutrients for organisms with layered mechanisms of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers such as the mouth and stomach prevent harmful substances and pathogens from entering the organism. If a harmful substance breaches these barriers, the innate digestive system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate digestive systems are found in all plants and animals. If harmful substances successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive digestive system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the digestive system adapts its response during digestion to improve its recognition of the harmful substance. This improved response is then retained after the substance has been eliminated, in the form of a digestive memory, and allows the adaptive digestive system to mount faster and stronger defenses each time this harmful substance is encountered."

        "answer": " Immunological amnesia",
        "context": "Immunological amnesia occurs when the immune system loses its ability to remember and effectively respond to specific pathogens. Despite the presence of layered defenses in organisms, such as physical barriers and the innate immune system, some pathogens can still breach these defenses. In such cases, the adaptive immune system in vertebrates is activated by the innate response to combat the infection.\n\nThe adaptive immune system is designed to adapt its response during an infection, improving its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is typically retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of Immunological amnesia. This memory allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time the pathogen is encountered.\n\nHowever, in cases of immunological amnesia, this memory is lost or compromised, leading to a weakened immune response. As a result, the adaptive immune system may not be able to effectively recognize and combat the pathogen upon subsequent encounters. This can lead to increased susceptibility to infections and a reduced ability for the organism to defend itself against previously encountered pathogens."

These cells work together to identify and eliminate harmful substances, either by attacking larger particles through contact or by breaking down and neutralizing smaller molecules. The digestive system's innate cells are also important mediators in the activation of the Digestive system, ensuring the body's overall health and well-being."

Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again. This is \"adaptive\" because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges. Immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short-term memory or passive long-term memory.\n\nIn the case of passive long-term memory, B cells play a crucial role. These B cells, once activated, produce offspring that develop into long-lived memory cells. These memory cells are capable of retaining information about specific pathogens for an extended period, allowing the immune system to respond more effectively if the same pathogen is encountered again. This passive long-term memory helps the immune system to be better prepared for future challenges and provides a more robust defense against infections."

This receptor acts as a signaling device that allows the T-cell to compete for the active form of vitamin D, the steroid hormone calcitriol. T-cells and vitamin D are in constant competition, as both require the same resources to function effectively.\n\nDespite this competition, T-cells express the gene CYP27B1, which is responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol, into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol. This conversion process is essential for both T-cells and vitamin D to carry out their respective functions. However, the competition between them means that only one can bind to calcitriol at a time, limiting the effectiveness of the other.\n\nOther immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes, and macrophages. These cells also engage in a competitive relationship with vitamin D, as they too require calcitriol to perform their intended functions. This competition between immune cells and vitamin D highlights the complex nature of their relationship and the delicate balance required for optimal immune system function."

According to the non-specific theory of immunity, represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff, it was cells – more precisely, phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses. These cells provided a generalized defense against various pathogens without targeting specific invaders. In contrast, the specific theory of immunity, held, among others, by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism’s “humors” rather than its cells. These molecules, such as antibodies, were tailored to recognize and neutralize specific pathogens, providing a targeted immune response."

In this strategy, the pathogen remains in close proximity to the host cells, allowing it to avoid direct contact with immune cells, antibodies, and complement. Some examples of pathogens that utilize intercellular pathogenesis include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella, and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. \n\nMany pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis.

These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system.

By reducing the overall prevalence of the disease in the population, the likelihood of these vulnerable individuals coming into contact with the pathogen is significantly decreased. \n\nHerd immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination, which is a key factor in achieving herd immunity.

The statement, also published as an editorial in the journal Science, stated \"we support the [TAR's] conclusion that it is at least 90% certain that temperatures will continue to rise, with average global surface temperature projected to increase by between 0.5 and 1.0 °C above 1990 levels by 2100\". The TAR has also been endorsed by the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences, Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society, and European Geosciences Union (refer to \"Endorsements of the IPCC\")."

The schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England. Even with this increase, the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007. The MBH00 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by Jones et al. 1998, Pollack, Huang & Shen 1998, Crowley & Lowery 2000 and Briffa 2000, using differing data and methods.

A rational number is not a prime number, as prime numbers are a subset of natural numbers greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. A rational number can be a whole number, a fraction, or a decimal that repeats or terminates.

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic does not apply to rational numbers, as it establishes the central role of primes in number theory, which are unique to natural numbers greater than 1. The uniqueness in the theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 · 3, 1 · 1 · 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3, but only within the context of natural numbers."

It is applicable to any triangle, whether it is a right-angled, acute-angled, or obtuse-angled triangle. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle. Mathematically, this can be expressed as a/b = c/C = A/a, where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, and A, B, and C are the angles opposite those sides, respectively.\n\nThe Law of Sines is particularly useful in solving triangles when given two angles and one side (AAS or ASA) or two sides and one angle not included between them (SSA). The uniqueness of the solutions in these cases depends on the specific values of the given angles and sides. For example, in the SSA case, there may be one, two, or no solutions depending on the relationship between the given side lengths and the sine of the given angle."

According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if n is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by n, then a^(n-1) is congruent to 1 modulo n. In other words, a^(n-1) % n = 1. This theorem can be used to test the primality of a number n by choosing random values of a and checking the congruence.\n\nFor example, to check the primality of 37, we can choose a = 2. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if 37 is prime, then 2^(37-1) % 37 should be equal to 1. Indeed, 2^36 % 37 = 1, which suggests that 37 is prime. However, it is important to note that Fermat's Little Theorem is not a definitive test for primality, as there are some composite numbers, called Carmichael numbers, that also satisfy the theorem.\n\nThis method can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to the square root of n is known—then the congruence needs to be checked only for those a values that are prime. For example, to check the primality of 37, only three congruence checks are necessary (a = 2, 3, and 5), given that 4 and 6 are composite."

This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n. If the result of any of these divisions is an integer, then n is not a prime, otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if n is composite (with factors a and b ≠ 1), then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most the square root of n. For example, for n = 37, the trial divisions are by m = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. None of these numbers divides 37, so 37 is prime. This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to the square root of n is known—then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime. For example, to check the primality of 37, only three divisions are necessary (m = 2, 3, and 5), given that 4 and 6 are composite.

Lucas numbers are similar to Fibonacci numbers, but they have different starting values. The sequence of Lucas numbers begins with 2, 1, and continues with each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones. Lucas primes are a subset of these numbers that are prime.\n\nOther primes where either p + 1 or p − 1 is of a particular shape include the Sophie Germain primes (primes of the form 2p + 1 with p prime), primorial primes, Lucas primes, and Mersenne primes, that is, prime numbers that are of the form 2p − 1, where p is an arbitrary prime. The Lucas–Lehmer test is particularly fast for numbers of this form. This is why the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime since the dawn of electronic computers.\n\nLucas primes share some properties with other special prime numbers, such as being part of a specific sequence or having a unique mathematical relationship. They are an interesting area of study in number theory and have applications in cryptography and computer science."

However, computing the lengths of the sides requires the knowledge of infinitely many prime numbers to begin with. One formula that can be used to find prime numbers is based on Bertrand's postulate (proven first by Chebyshev), which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n − 2, for any natural number n > 3.\n\nAnother formula that can be helpful in solving problems related to the Pythagorean theorem is based on Pythagorean theorem.

During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the southern part of the present Mediterranean Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the Strait of Gibraltar. This caused the Rhine's course to be diverted through the Strait of Gibraltar.

Beyond these rivers, Rome only held the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest, and a few scattered bridge-heads. The northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until The Rhine stopped being a Roman boundary during the reign of Julius Caesar. The southern part was different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed. The frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between modern-day Baden and Württemberg.

        "answer": " Political",
        "context": "The outcome of most political decisions can be predicted beforehand since political parties typically instruct their members on how to vote. Parties assign certain politicians, known as whips, with the responsibility of ensuring that party members adhere to the party line. Politicians do not usually vote against such instructions, as doing so may hinder their chances of reaching higher political ranks within their parties. Disobedient members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in severe cases, may even be expelled from their parties entirely. Consequently, as with many political institutions, the independence of politicians tends to be low, and rebellions by those who are discontent with their party's policies are rare. In some situations, however, parties announce \"free votes\", which allows politicians to vote according to their personal beliefs. This is typically done on Political issues."

Its members are drawn from various political parties, reflecting the balance of power in Parliament. The committee's primary responsibility is to scrutinize and evaluate the policies and actions of the Scottish Government's Health and Sport Department, ensuring that they are in line with the best interests of the public. This may involve reviewing legislation, conducting inquiries, and holding hearings with relevant stakeholders. By doing so, the Health and Sport Committee plays a crucial role in shaping the direction of health and sports policy in Scotland."

During this address, the First Minister outlines the Government's legislative programme for the upcoming year, providing a comprehensive overview of the planned initiatives and policies.\n\nFollowing the delivery of the State of the Nation address, leaders of the opposition parties, as well as other MSPs, have the opportunity to question the First Minister on issues related to the content of the speech. This process ensures that the Government's plans are thoroughly examined and debated, fostering transparency and accountability in our political system.\n\nIn conclusion, the State of the Nation address serves as a vital platform for the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government's actions and hold them accountable for their decisions. This process is a cornerstone of our democracy, ensuring that the voices of the people are heard and that the Government remains focused on addressing the needs and concerns of the nation."

The First Minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, at the beginning of each parliamentary year, the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber outlining the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year. After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the delivery of the statement.\n\nIssues related to the delivery of the statement may include the clarity of the message, the accuracy of the information provided, and the relevance of the topics covered. Additionally, MSPs may inquire about the timeline for implementing the legislative programme, the resources allocated to specific initiatives, and the expected outcomes of the proposed policies. By addressing these issues, the Scottish Parliament ensures that the Government's plans are thoroughly examined and held accountable."

This phenomenon is known as the The Peter Principle and has led to criticism. Following the Conservative victory in the 2015 UK election, standing orders of the House of Commons were changed to give MPs representing English constituencies a new \"veto\" over laws only affecting England.\n\nIn relation to the Peter Principle, this situation can be seen as an example of individuals being promoted to a level of incompetence. The Scottish MPs, who are elected to represent their constituents in the UK Parliament, are given the power to vote on legislation that does not directly affect their constituents. This can lead to a situation where these MPs may not have the necessary expertise or understanding of the issues at hand, resulting in decisions that may not be in the best interest of the people they are meant to represent.\n\nThe Peter Principle suggests that people are often promoted based on their performance in their current role, rather than their ability to perform in the new role. In the case of the The Peter Principle, the Scottish MPs may have been successful in their roles as representatives of their constituents in the Scottish Parliament, but their promotion to the UK House of Commons may have placed them in a position where they are less effective.\n\nThe introduction of the \"veto\" for English MPs in 2015 can be seen as an attempt to address this issue by ensuring that those with the most relevant knowledge and experience are able to make decisions on legislation that directly affects their constituents. However, this solution may not fully address the underlying issue of the Peter Principle, as it does not guarantee that the MPs making these decisions are necessarily the most competent individuals for the task."

In 2014, the group proclaimed itself a caliphate, with religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide. As of March 2015[update], it had control over territory occupied by ten million people in Iraq and Syria, and has nominal control over small areas of Libya, Nigeria and Afghanistan. (While a self-described state, it lacks international Military support.) The group also operates or has affiliates in other parts of the world, including North Africa and South Asia.\n\nThe military support for the Islamic State primarily consists of Sunni Arab fighters from Iraq and Syria, who are driven by the group's extremist ideology. The group has been able to gain control over vast territories in Iraq and Syria, as well as establish a presence in Libya, Nigeria, and Afghanistan. This military expansion has been facilitated by the group's access to weapons, funding, and recruitment of new fighters. The Islamic State's military capabilities have been a significant factor in its ability to maintain control over its territories and continue its operations in other parts of the world."

Nationalism and patriotism have been used in order to describe one's pride, loyalty, and attachment to a nation or group of people. Robert Young writes that while nationalism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as cultural reasons, patriotism is simply the expression of love and devotion for one's country or homeland. Patriotism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of emotional attachment to one's nation, while nationalism may involve a more political or ideological focus.\n\nParticularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between nationalism and patriotism by stating; \"nationalism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a unifying and dominating force within a nation', while patriotism refers to the 'expression of love and devotion to one's homeland.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of patriotism. Thus it can be said that nationalism includes some form of patriotism, but patriotism itself does not automatically imply nationalism, as it lacks a political focus."

        "context": "Orientalism, as theorized by Edward Said, refers to how the West developed an imaginative geography of the East. This imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the East. Rather, by essentializing the East, this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities to create difference and distance between \"we\" the West and \"them\" the East, or \"here\" in the West and \"there\" in the East. This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as regressive and stagnant in opposition to the Regressive and forward-thinking West. Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the West’s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled. The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism, as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories."

O termo \"Imperialismo\" foi originalmente introduzido no inglês em seu sentido atual no final da década de 1870 por opositores das políticas imperiais supostamente agressivas e ostensivas do primeiro-ministro britânico Benjamin Disraeli. Pouco tempo depois, foi apropriado por apoiadores do \"imperialismo\", como Joseph Chamberlain. Para alguns, o imperialismo designava uma política de idealismo e filantropia; outros alegavam que era caracterizado pelo interesse político próprio, e um número crescente o associava à ganância capitalista. O liberal John A. Hobson e o marxista Vladimir Lenin adicionaram uma conotação macroeconômica mais teórica ao termo. Lenin, em particular, exerceu uma influência substancial sobre as concepções marxistas posteriores do imperialismo com sua obra Imperialismo, o Estágio Superior do Capitalismo. Em seus escritos, Lenin retratou o imperialismo como uma extensão natural do capitalismo que surgiu da necessidade das economias capitalistas de expandir constantemente investimentos, recursos materiais e mão de obra de tal maneira que exigia a expansão colonial. Essa concepção de imperialismo como uma característica estrutural do capitalismo é ecoada por teóricos marxistas posteriores. Muitos teóricos da esquerda seguiram enfatizando o caráter estrutural ou sistêmico do \"imperialismo\". Tais escritores expandiram o período de tempo associado ao termo, de modo que agora não designa uma política, nem um curto espaço de décadas no final do século XIX, mas um sistema mundial que se estende por um período de séculos, muitas vezes voltando a Cristóvão Colombo e, em algumas contas, às Cruzadas. À medida que a aplicação do termo se expandiu, seu significado mudou ao longo de cinco eixos distintos, mas frequentemente paralelos: o moral, o econômico, o sistêmico, o cultural e o temporal. Essas mudanças refletem - entre outras mudanças de sensibilidade - um crescente desconforto, até mesmo repulsa, com o fato do poder, especificamente, o poder ocidental."

Although not a maritime power and not yet a fully developed nation-state, Germany had only begun to engage in imperialist activities in the Early 20th century. Austria's involvement in imperialism was primarily due to the Habsburg control of the First Empire, the Spanish throne, and other royal houses. [further explanation needed]\n\nFollowing the defeat of Napoleon, who caused the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Prussia and the German states continued to focus on European affairs through the Concert of Europe, rather than engaging in imperialism. After Prussia unified the other states into the second German Empire following the Franco-German War, its long-time Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck (1862–90), remained skeptical of colonial acquisitions. Bismarck argued that the costs of obtaining, maintaining, and defending colonies would outweigh any potential benefits.\n\nHe believed that colonies did not pay for themselves, that the German bureaucratic system would not function effectively in the tropics, and that diplomatic disputes over colonies would distract Germany from its central interest, Europe itself. As a result, Germany's imperialist endeavors remained limited in scope during the early 20th century, with the nation primarily focusing on its interests within Europe."

This policy expanded The Roosevelt Corollary by asserting the right of the United States to intervene in the affairs of Latin American nations to preserve stability and protect American interests.\n\nThe Roosevelt Corollary was often backed by military force but was more frequently implemented through behind-the-scenes influence. This approach is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires. In 1898, Americans who opposed imperialism created the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba. One year later, a war erupted in the Philippines, causing business, labor, and government leaders in the US to condemn America's occupation in the Philippines.

He said, \"Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts.

The Ottoman Empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, but it dissolved in the aftermath of The Treaty of Versailles, leading to the emergence of the new state of Turkey in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland, as well as the creation of modern Balkan and Middle Eastern states, thus ending Turkish colonial ambitions.

According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 638,000, Jews constituted 219,000 (around 34% percent). Warsaw's prewar Jewish population of more than 350,000 constituted about 30 percent of the River's total population. In 1933, out of 1,178,914 inhabitants 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue. World War II changed the demographics of the River, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw's history. Most of the modern day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanisation.\n\nIn the context of Warsaw's geography, the River A played a significant role in the River's development and diversity. The river served as a natural barrier and a source of sustenance for the inhabitants, attracting various ethnic groups to settle along its banks. The presence of the river contributed to the River's economic growth, as it facilitated trade and transportation. Over the years, the river has witnessed the River's transformation and has been an essential part of Warsaw's rich history. Today, the River A remains an important landmark and a symbol of the River's resilience and diversity."

        "context": "In 1939, approximately 1,300,000 people resided in Warsaw, but by 1945, the population had drastically reduced to 420,000. To address the rapid population growth of around 6% in the first few years after the war, the city faced a shortage of housing and space for new construction. The initial solution was to expand the area of Warsaw in 1951. However, city authorities still had to implement residency registration restrictions to manage the population growth.\n\nUnder these limitations, only spouses and children of permanent residents, as well as certain individuals of public importance (such as renowned specialists), were allowed to register as residents. This measure effectively halved the population growth in the subsequent years. As a result, a belief emerged among Poles that Varsovians considered themselves superior simply because they lived in the capital. This perception still exists in Poland to some extent, although it has diminished over time. Since 1990, there have been no restrictions on residency registration, allowing for a more equal distribution of the population."

During the first years after the war, the growth of voting age population was c. 6%, so shortly the city started to suffer from the lack of representation and areas for new community centers. The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951) – but the city authorities were still forced to introduce voting age population registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the growth of voting age population in the following years. It also bolstered some kind of conviction among Poles that Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital. Unfortunately, this belief still lives on in Poland (although not as much as it used to be) – even though since 1990 there are no limitations to voting age population registration anymore."

        "context": "In 1755, six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock, the newly arrived British Army commander, and planned a four-way attack on the French, including an eventual annexation of Quebec. None of the initial attacks succeeded, and the main effort by Braddock was a disaster; he was defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9, 1755, and died a few days later. British operations in 1755, 1756, and 1757 in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York all failed, due to a combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies. \n\nIn 1755, the British captured Fort Beauséjour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia; soon afterward, they ordered the Annexation of Quebec. Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley, Commander-in-Chief, North America, without direction from Great Britain. The Acadians, both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty, were expelled. Native Americans were likewise driven off their land to make way for settlers from New England.\n\nDespite these setbacks, the British continued their efforts to annex Quebec. The British forces eventually succeeded in capturing Quebec in 1759, during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, which was a turning point in the Seven Years' War. The British victory led to the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763, which formally ceded Canada, including Quebec, to the British Empire."

        "context": "In 1757, the British campaigns in North America faced significant setbacks, including a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry, which led to the torture and massacre of British victims by Indian forces. As a result, the British government fell, and William Pitt rose to power. He substantially increased British military resources in the colonies during a time when France was reluctant to invest heavily in North America, focusing instead on their European conflicts against Prussia and its allies.\n\nBetween 1758 and 1760, the British military initiated a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada, taking advantage of the minimal resources France had allocated to the region. The British forces succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and eventually Quebec. Although the British were later defeated at Sainte Foy in Quebec, the French ultimately ceded Canada to the British as per the terms of the 1763 treaty, due in part to their decision to prioritize their European conflicts over their North American territories."

As there had already been a King George's War in the 1740s, British colonists named the second war in King George's reign after their opponents, and it became known as the French and Indian War. This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict, and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain. American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War. Other, less frequently used names for the war include the The Seven Years' War.\n\nThe Seven Years' War, also known as the French and Indian War, was a significant conflict that involved multiple nations, including France, Great Britain, and various Native American tribes. The war was fought on several fronts, including North America, Europe, and other regions around the world. The conflict was characterized by the struggle for dominance between the two major European powers, France and Great Britain, with Native American tribes supporting both sides. The Seven Years' War ultimately resulted in significant territorial changes and reshaped the balance of power in Europe and North America."

As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. \n\nIn response to the French advances, the British forces, led by C, decided to retreat from the Ohio Valley and regroup. This decision was influenced by the growing tensions between the British and the Iroquois, particularly Tanaghrisson, a chief of the Mingo, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. Tanaghrisson intensely disliked the French (whom he accused of killing and eating his father). Traveling to Fort Le Boeuf, he threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.

This law can be represented through kinematic measurements and is a fundamental principle in classical physics. While advanced physics uses reference frame analysis to describe kinematics in detail, there are still unresolved questions regarding the proper definition of mass.\n\nNewton's laws of motion, including the second law, provide a foundation for understanding the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. However, the concept of mass becomes more complex when considering theories like general relativity, which proposes an equivalence between space-time and mass. This connection raises questions about the relevance of mass on microscales, especially in the absence of a coherent theory of quantum gravity.\n\nBy considering Newton's second law as a quantitative definition of mass, we can write the law as an equality, fixing the relative units of force and mass. This approach allows us to better understand the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, even though the deeper nature of mass remains an open question in modern physics."

        "context": "Newton's Second Law is a fundamental principle that describes the relationship between an object's mass, acceleration, and the net force acting upon it. The second law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, this can be represented as F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass of the object, and a is its acceleration.\n\nThe second law implies that when a force is applied to an object, it will cause the object to accelerate in the direction of the force. This acceleration is dependent on the magnitude of the force and the mass of the object. A larger force will result in a greater acceleration, while a larger mass will result in a smaller acceleration.\n\nThis law is essential in understanding the motion of objects and is widely used in various fields, such as physics, engineering, and even sports. The second law helps us predict how an object will move under the influence of different forces and allows us to calculate the required force to achieve a desired acceleration.\n\nIn summary, Newton's Second Law establishes the relationship between the net force acting on an object, its mass, and the resulting acceleration. It states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass, which can be represented by the equation F = ma. This law is crucial in understanding and predicting the motion of objects under the influence of various forces."

        "context": "Archimedes' Principle is a result of applying the concept of buoyancy to situations where the forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects submerged in fluids. The principle states that the upward buoyant force exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces. This principle is applicable to both floating and submerged objects, and it helps to explain why some objects float while others sink.\n\nThe principle means that all buoyant forces are interactions between the object and the fluid it is submerged in, and thus there is no such thing as a unidirectional buoyant force or a force that acts on only one body. Whenever a first body displaces a volume of fluid, the fluid exerts an upward buoyant force on the body. The buoyant force and the weight of the displaced fluid are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This principle is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law in the context of buoyancy, with the buoyant force called the \"action\" and the weight of the displaced fluid the \"reaction\". The action and the reaction are simultaneous."

Simple experiments showed that Einstein's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls.

Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant deceleration and deceleration were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship decelerating at a constant rate, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a decelerating ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to decelerate with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no backward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to decelerate with the same rate as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball decelerating at the constant backward velocity."

Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This results in both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction in the opposite direction of the curving path."
