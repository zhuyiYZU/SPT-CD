The large group -- which police believe was affiliated with Patriot Front -- was seen at a hotel piling into a U-Haul with riot gear, the caller told a 911 dispatcher. They were later pulled over and arrested, Coeur d'Alene Police Chief Lee White said. (CNN) Idaho police officers arrested 31 people Saturday who are believed to be affiliated with the White nationalist group Patriot Front, after they were seen gathering near a Pride parade in the city of Coeur d'Alene, authorities said. \"It is clear to us based on the gear that the individuals had with them, the stuff they had in their possession, the U-Haul with them along with paperwork that was seized from them, that they came to riot downtown,\" Coeur d'Alene Police Chief Lee White said during a news conference. CNN — The people believed to be affiliated with White nationalist group Patriot Front arrested in Idaho over the weekend appear to have been well-prepared with detailed plans and protective gear to “antagonize and cause disorder” at the Coeur d’Alene Pride event on Saturday, according to a new court filing. (CNN) With Pride celebrations scheduled throughout the month in cities big and small across the country, organizers and police departments are taking a close look at their safety plans. Over two dozen men were arrested after an alarmed 911 caller reported a group dressed like a \"little army\" getting into a moving truck. The group was headed to a Pride in the Park event at Coeur d'Alene City Park and had plans to riot, police said. Thirty-one members of the national white supremacist group Patriot Front were arrested Saturday in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and charged with conspiracy to riot, a misdemeanor, according to police. In a news conference Saturday, Police Chief Lee White said a concerned citizen reported \"a little army\" of about 20 people wearing masks and holding shields loading into a U-Haul truck. Police pulled over the truck about 10 minutes later, White said. (CNN) A Pride event in Coeur d'Alene, a small city in Idaho's panhandle, might seem like an odd target for one of the country's most active White supremacist groups . But on Saturday, 31 White men believed by authorities to be affiliated with the group Patriot Front huddled in the back of a U-Haul, allegedly planning to disrupt the gathering of LGBTQ people and allies in the city. (The men were charged with misdemeanor counts of conspiracy to riot.) But both the place and the event make sense in the context of a White nationalist movement that combines spectacles of deadly terrorism with efforts to integrate itself into the mainstream right in the US. Those two strands of the movement may seem to be at odds -- the lethal violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, for instance, helped trigger the collapse of several far-right and neo-Nazi organizations and largely sidelined its organizers -- but they have in fact proven to be a potent pairing. U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell doesn't seem bothered by ethical questions about whether Kentucky has had too much access to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. In fact, his reelection campaign is trumpeting that news. This week, McConnell's campaign promoted a Politico story about the higher number of meetings Kentucky officials had with Chao — his wife of more than 25 years — compared with representatives from other states, even though that disparity raises concerns.

Dr. Ashish Jha, coordinator of the federal COVID-19 response, told reporters the Biden administration is working closely with states, pharmacies and other health care providers to prepare for authorization from key regulatory agencies. (CNN) About 18 million children under the age of 5 in the United States could soon be eligible to get a Covid-19 vaccine -- but first, the child-sized shot must go through a rigorous authorization process that's taking a different path than the Covid-19 vaccines that came before. On Tuesday, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they had initiated a rolling submission to the US Food and Drug Administration of data for their vaccine for children ages 6 months up to 5 years. The companies expect to complete the request for emergency use authorization soon. After enduring months of confusion and multiple setbacks, parents of young children were elated to find out Moderna plans to request the Food and Drug Administration to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine for kids under 6. Although parents welcomed the much-anticipated news, the BA.2 strain of the omicron variant continues to gain ground in the U.S., and access to these life-saving vaccines for 18 million of the nation's youngest is still weeks away. An FDA expert advisory panel meets this week and will likely recommend two COVID vaccines for the youngest children. The vaccines under review are Moderna's for ages 6 months to 17 years and Pfizer-BioNTech's for children ages 6 months to 5 years. COVID-19 vaccines could be available for America's smallest children as soon as June 21, assuming regulatory authorities sign off on the shots next week. The Biden administration early Thursday released its plans for distributing low-dose vaccines for children ages 6 months to under 5, the last major group of Americans to receive access to the shots.

(CNN) While all entrances of Yellowstone National Park are temporarily closed because flooding has damaged roads and bridges, the park's northern portion in particular may remain closed for \"a substantial length of time,\" park officials said Tuesday. \"Many sections of road in (the park's northern areas) are completely gone and will require substantial time and effort to reconstruct,\" a news release reads. \" ... It is probable that road sections in northern Yellowstone will not reopen this season due to the time required for repairs.\" Matthew Brown and Lindsay Whitehurst The Associated Press It was supposed to be a banner year for America's oldest national park. Yellowstone turned 150 in March. A whole series of in-person and virtual events were planned to mark the occasion.

        "context": "British summers could regularly reach a “new normal” of 40C within a decade warn meteorologists in a new study by the Met Office. “Wild weather has been a feature of this UK summer thus far, with scorching sunshine, pouring rain and powerful thunderstorms all making an appearance,” says Sky News. Boris Johnson has admitted he is “very worried” that Cop26 “might go wrong” as the clock ticks down until the UK-hosted climate summit gets under way. Answering questions from schoolchildren at a special Downing Street news conference this week, the prime minister said it would be “touch and go” whether world leaders could achieve the necessary agreements to protect the planet. But he added: “I think it can be done.” Here is what the rest of the world is saying. Scottish setting “It was once dubbed Europe’s murder capital, but this year it was voted the world’s friendliest city,” said Al Jazeera. Glasgow, “home to one of the most bitter football rivalries”, has rarely lacked drama and from Sunday will “take centre stage as the host of a highly anticipated summit seen by many as the last chance to avert a global climate catastrophe”. The news site, which is part-funded by the Qatari government, predicted that this “city of contrasts” will either be “hailed as the scene of a spectacular success or lamented as the place where dreams of a better tomorrow were extinguished”. Temperature talk The activists and delegates heading to the Scottish city from across the world “have reason to be anxious”, wrote climate campaigner Eleanor Salter in The New York Times. The summit represents “perhaps one of the world’s last chances” to limit the rise in global average temperature to less than 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Johnson has generally displayed “bombastic optimism” that other countries will step up, said Salter, but Britain is “far from a climate hero”. A “glance” behind Johnson’s speeches “reveals hypocrisy everywhere”. Despite “a smoke screen of good words”, the UK “is pursuing policies at home and abroad that violate every single goal” set for Cop26, she continued. And ultimately, “warm words won’t stop a warming world”. Pressing agendas The negotiations “are likely to be fraught”, said France24. The “rulebook” on how climate goals are measured is yet to be finalised, “long-festering disputes” over the governance of carbon markets persist, and poorer nations are calling on wealthier ones to make good on funding promises. Skip advert Wealthy nations have yet to meet a target set at Cop15 to provide $100bn a year in funding to help developing nations tackle the front-line effects of global warming. The UK government’s newly published Climate Finance Delivery Plan said the goal is unlikely to be achieved until 2023. In an article for the Financial Times, the Democratic Republic of Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi wrote that Africa is “tired of waiting” for financial support and “must be a priority” at Cop26. The continent “contributes so little global warming” yet faces “a cruel fate”, said Tshisekedi, who is chair of the African Union. A “clear plan” is needed on how resources to fight climate change will be deployed, he argued, adding: “It is time for Africa to be compensated – for the good of the continent and the planet. We have waited long enough.” Contentious conversations Cop26 President Alok Sharma has admitted that the absence of some leading global figures will be a stumbling block in achieving the summit goals. The no-shows will include Vladimir Putin, owing to the coronavirus situation in Russia. However, Kremlin-owned news agency TASS said that the Russian president and Johnson had discussed “climate problems” together “in detail” this week, in their first joint telephone call since May last year. The British leader “welcomed” Russia’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2060, the agency added – although this target date is a decade later that that set by most other developed nations. Although the “leaders of most of the world’s biggest greenhouse emitters will gather in Scotland”, said The Japan Times, “the man running the biggest of them all”, China’s President Xi Jinping, also “likely won’t be there”. Ultimately, “if the rich world fails to demonstrate solidarity and leadership, it will have no moral standing to criticise China”, wrote Sam Geall, a specialist in Chinese climate policy and politics, in The Sydney Morning Herald. Eyes will also be on other major fossil fuel emitters including Australia. The country’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison has this week adopted the 2050 target, but “sadly”, that’s where the “good news begins and ends”, said The Guardian Australia columnist Katherine Murphy. Skip advert No strategy or legislation for achieving this goal has been put forward by Morrison so far, Murphy noted. In fact, the “pre-Glasgow crescendo” has left us with a so-called new plan that is simply “the status quo” served up with “some new speculative graphs”. Covid complications The Covid-19 pandemic delayed the summit by a year and could yet cause further disruption. A cartoon by Liu Rui in China’s Global Times English-language paper portrays the UK as a “dangerous climate” for the summit, as Britain battles one of the highest case rates in western Europe. The words “extreme”, “intolerable” and “record-breaking” are cropping up more and more in news headlines about our planet’s climate. The Pakistani city of Jacobabad recently officially surpassed the temperature threshold that humans can withstand - “albeit briefly”, The Telegraph notes. Days later, experts in the US reported that a “heat dome” was to blame for blistering temperatures in the Pacific Northwest that saw the mercury hitting 46.6°C in the Oregon city of Portland. On the other side of the Atlantic, more than 150 people have died as a result of extreme flooding in Germany, with hundreds more missing, and further flood-related fatalities reported in neighbouring Belgium. And in Asia, authorities in Henan province issued the highest level of weather warning this week as torrential rain swept across wide swathes of north and central China. Each of these extreme weather events has triggered fresh warnings from scientists and politicians about the ever-increasing threat posed by climate change. As Germany and Belgium, along with parts of the Netherlands and Luxembourg, reeled from the effects of days of intense rainfall there, Potsdam-based climatologist Dieter Gerten told National Geographic that the situation was “not so surprising” to scientists. “The increase of extreme events is something we’ve seen in climate model projections,\" he added. So what can science tell us about the current course of climate change, and whether it can be slowed - or even reversed? Heating up Human activities have been heating the planet since the Industrial Revolution, a period commonly used as a baseline against which global temperatures are monitored. Global average temperatures increased rapidly in the second half of the 20th century, and “this warming has been particularly rapid since the 1970s“, says the Met Office. This acceleration has triggered calls for united action by world leaders. The “historic, durable and ambitious” goals set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement were lauded as “the world’s greatest diplomatic success” by The Guardian at the time of the signing. But on the treaty's fifth anniversary, in December 2020, the president of this year’s COP26 summit, Alok Sharma, told national leaders to be “honest” with themselves and admit that “as encouraging as all this ambition is, it is not enough”. Skip advert In May, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) secretary-general Professor Petteri Taalas warned that new research findings had delivered “yet another wake-up call” about the need to fast-track commitments to slash greenhouse gas emissions and achieve carbon neutrality. According to a WMO climate update, there is a 90% chance that one of the years between 2021 and 2025 will become the hottest on record, and a 40% likelihood that the annual average global temperature will temporarily reach 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in the same period. A separate WMO report published in April warned that monitoring showed that global greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2020, “despite setbacks from Covid-19” to industrial processes. And the decade from 2011 was the warmest on record, the report said. Future outlook Signatories of the Paris Agreement committed to limiting global warming to well below 2C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5C. As the World Resources Institute (WRI) noted back in 2018, this difference of “half a degree of warming matters - a lot”. The London-based think tank pointed to research from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of the world’s leading climate scientists, which found that with a 2C increase, 37% of the world’s population would be exposed to severe heat waves at least once in five years, compared with 14% at 1.5C of warming. And “at 2C warming, 18% of insects globally, 16% of plants and 8% of vertebrates are projected to lose more than half of their ranges”, said the WRI. “With 1.5C of warming, this is reduced by two-thirds for insects, and by half for plants and vertebrates.” The difference of half a degree could also prove crucial in the Arctic, where global warming is triggering rising sea levels, sea ice loss and changes to permafrost. “Over the past 49 years, the Arctic has warmed three times faster than the world as a whole,” according to the latest annual update from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme, which predicts that “the first ice-free September in the Arctic could occur as early as 2040”. Global warming is also expected to lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Freak weather “such as abnormally heavy rainfall, prolonged droughts, desertification, environmental degradation, or sea-level rise and cyclones, are already causing an average of more than 20 million people to leave their homes and move to other areas in their countries each year”, says the UN Refugee Agency. Climate change has major implications for the production of goods and services needed to sustain communities too, especially in industies such as agriculture. A report published in The Lancet recently warns that “both labour supply and productivity are projected to decrease under future climate change in most parts of the world, and particularly in tropical regions”. Skip advert (CNN) Europe swung from unusually cold temperatures in the spring to its hottest summer on record last year, smashing temperature and daily rain records, while Mediterranean wildfires burned through land around the size of Cyprus. They are the main findings of the fifth European State of the Climate report, published Friday, which found the summer of 2021 was 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than the 1991-2020 average. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has not always seen eye to eye with his older brother Piers, as was seen at a party conference fringe event this week. Piers began “shouting and refused requests to leave” at the radical-left World Transformed event at which his brother was a panellist, The Guardian reported. And when asked if Jeremy would be upset by the disruption, Piers apparently said “I don’t care”. It comes two months after the “eccentric disseminator of anti-vaccine materials” did his “best to steal his borther’s thunder” as the MP protested in Downing Street for a 15% pay rise for health workers, said The Spectator’s Steerpike. Piers could be heard shouting “no more lockdowns” and “end the Covid con”. “With brothers like these, who needs enemies?” asked the gossip columnist. Early life “[Piers] Corbyn says that the day he was born, March 10, 1947, nature put on a spectacular show,” wrote Tom Standage in Wired, after interviewing him in 1999. “One of the largest sunspots ever recorded had appeared on the sun.” It was an apt arrival for the future long-range weather forecaster. One of four boys, he grew up in “bucolic bliss”, said Tatler, first in Wiltshire, then Shropshire. He described himself as “very inquiring” as a child and would “ask questions that there weren’t really answers for”, said Standage. Surrounded by homemade meteorological tools including an anemometer and rain gauge, as a teenager he began keeping daily records of the weather. Piers earned a scholarship to study physics at Imperial College London and graduated with a first. In 1979, he then began a master’s in astrophysics at Queen Mary College, where he became interested in the link “between solar activity and terrestrial weather”, said Standage. By observing the activity of the sun, he believed he might be able to predict the weather months in advance. Skip advert He developed a formula for forecasting the weather months into the future, wrote Monica Porter in The Article. Then, in 1984, “a singular event changed the course of his working life”, said The Observer. At the beginning of the year, the International Marxist Group (IMG) asked him to forecast how cold the weather would be in winter. The IMG was planning a strike and “they wanted to know whether it was going to be cold enough for the strike… to bring Britain to his knees”, he told the newspaper. His prediction was correct, it proved to be an “unusually cold” winter. Career The Independent’s Simon Usborne once said Corbyn “defies categorisation”, but gave it a go anyway, describing him as “a left-wing physicist turned political activist and councillor, turned conspiracy theorist and maverick weather forecaster”. In the early days of his forecasting career, Corbyn and his girlfriend at the time “no doubt spent a lot of time looking anxiously at the sky”, The Observer said. He had begun placing bets on his forecasts, which proved accurate enough that “it would pay the rent basically”, he told the newspaper. Businesses became interested in Corbyn’s services, which he started to sell. In 1995 he formed WeatherAction, a long-range weather forecast firm based in southeast London that still operates today. Filmmakers, clothing retailers and petrochemical companies were among those who began relying on its forecasts. An annual subscription costing “£24,000 and upward” in the late 1990s, with most services costing “anywhere between £480 and £6,000”, according to Wired. An early customer of Corbyn’s, who used the service to predict winter demand for electricity, told the magazine he “would put the success rate of Corbyn’s forecasts in the excess of 70%”. The company faced an “uphill struggle” in winning new clients, partly due to “an outcry from mainstream meteorologists” fuelled by the mystery shrouding Corbyn’s forecasting methodology. His “secret formula”, he assured the magazine, is “locked safely away in case he gets hit by a bus”. But “adversity has only stiffened Corbyn’s resolve”, said The Observer. By 1997 “he had just become very rich indeed”, said The Article’s Porter. With “hundreds of clients”, and a stint on the stock exchange, “the nutty professor and one-time scourge of the Establishment had morphed into a City tycoon”. WeatherAction was on the stock exchange for two years before returning to private ownership. Skip advert When speaking to Porter around that time, Corbyn said that “he had no idea” what his brother Jeremy thought of his forecasting business, “as they hadn’t been on speaking terms for years”. Controversy Corbyn has “clashed” with his brother Jeremy over coronavirus and climate policy, The Telegraph reported. The elder Corbyn brother is often referred to as a climate change denier, and has been described as a “conspiracy theorist”, said Tatler. He has called Greta Thunberg an “ignorant, brainwashed child” and in 2018 he told LBC that the findings of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report were a “pack of lies”. The report’s conclusions, he said, were “anti-scientific nonsense based on fraud”. Professor Stuart Haszeldine, a geoscientist, rebutted Corbyn’s statements on the same programme, saying he was “on a different set of belief systems” to that of the forecaster. “I deal with facts and information.” Disabled man dies at Gatwick A disabled man left waiting on a plane died at Gatwick’s Airport after getting off without a helper. The Sun said the passenger became “the first victim of Britain’s airport chaos” after he fell to his death from an escalator. The tabloid said the man had been waiting for assistance from an EasyJet flight but became frustrated by delays, prompting him to leave the plane into the packed terminal, where the accident occurred. Gatwick said “staff shortages were not a factor in this incident” and “an investigation is under way”. A new anti-cholesterol jab could save 30,000 lives within a decade when it is made available on the NHS in England and Wales. Inclisiran, which is set to be offered to hundreds of thousands of people, has been described as a “game changer” by health professionals. The next ten years will be “pivotal” in protecting the future of the planet, Boris Johnson has warned following the publication of a UN report that says human activitiy is “unequivocally” causing climate change. The prime minister described the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) as “sobering reading”, while UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the findings were a “code red for humanity”. The message from climate scientists in last week’s landmark report was clear, said The Observer: humanity must wean itself off fossil fuels now. While every nation must play its part, there’s a particular onus on Britain. It was here, after all, that the Industrial Revolution began, and it is Britain that is hosting the UN’s critical climate summit, COP26, in November. Many nations at the event in Glasgow will be looking to the UK for leadership, but it will be in little position to offer it. The Government has not only failed to set out a clear strategy for achieving net-zero emissions in the near future; it’s also continuing to support measures that directly undermine that goal. This “list of incompatibilities” includes the recent closing of the Green Homes Grant insulation scheme; freezing fuel duty; encouraging airport expansion; and delaying the phasing out of gas boilers beyond the planned date of 2035. Boris Johnson has committed to cutting the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions by 78% of 1990 levels by 2035, and achieving net zero by 2050, said Elliot Chappell on LabourList.org. But based on its current trajectory, the UK is, according to government advisers, on course to cut only a fifth of the emissions needed to meet the 2035 target. To make matters worse, the PM is also facing a backlash from “reactive elements” in his party over his green agenda, such as it is. Among those warning that it risks alienating voters is Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith, who described it as a “hard sell asking people to make sacrifices when the rest of the world, China/Russia etc, are carrying on as usual”. When Theresa May committed the UK to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the then prime minister did not say who would be footing the bill. And two years after the goal was set, that question remains unanswered. As the UK prepares to host the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, Boris Johnson has said that the transition to a greener economy is not “some expensive politically correct green act of ‘bunny hugging’”, but rather “about growth and jobs”. Yet calculating the costs of reaching the net zero target “with any accuracy is difficult, given the level of uncertainty around new and emerging technologies, and changes in the economy and people’s behaviour”, says the Institute for Government. Analysis “will undoubtedly change in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic” too, adds the independent think tank, which advises ministers. But modelling and forecasts indicate that significant investment is required in the very near future in order to achieve the net zero target. How much will net zero cost? The government is required to set five-yearly carbon budgets after taking advice from the Climate Change Committee (CCC), an independent statutory body formed under the Climate Change Act 2008. The CCC’s Sixth Carbon Budget, published last December, estimated that the total costs of transitioning to net zero emissions would be “below 1% of GDP throughout the next 30 years”. This represents a significant reduction from the 1% to 2% of GDP forecast in the Fifth Carbon Budget, published in 2015. The CCC’s latest budget also made clear that reaching net zero “will be capital-intensive, with increased upfront spending” required. According to the report, to reach the 2050 target, the UK’s low carbon investment would need to increase to around £50bn a year by 2030 - roughly five times the level seen in 2020. The advisory body said that “the increase is deliverable, primarily by private companies and individuals, alongside other investment, provided effective policy is put in place”. Skip advert However, modelling by the National Grid of four “different pathways” to net zero - ranging from “Steady Progression” to “Leading the Way” - indicates that the cost could be far higher, with a net value of up to £3.2trn by 2050. But like the CCC, the power giant’s forecasts indicate that immediate increased investment is needed. The experts argue that as well as benefitting the environment, such investment would make financial sense. The CCC says an inital increase in spending to hit net zero would yield “ongoing savings in fuel costs”, with the cost of electric vehicle batteries falling by 65% between 2020 and 2050, and the cost of renewable electricity supplies cut by up to 27%. Indeed, forecasts indicate that savings in operational spending “will start to exceed the annual investment” by 2040, the Financial Times reported in March. Green energy consultant Josh Buckland told the newspaper that while the challenges involved in transitioning to eco-friendly transport were relatively “solvable”, making UK homes greener would be “far more problematic”, requiring both significant financial investment and “a massive shift in consumer attitudes”. The CCC says that “against the current backdrop of low investment, low interest and high unemployment”, pumping money into low carbon should have a positive effect on the economy. But how the government conveys that message to the public may prove key to the success of the push to hit net zero. Who will pay? CCC boss Chris Stark told business leaders in 2019 that “further progress” in achieving net zero would require a “thorough review” of “how these costs are distributed”. “We must consider the appropriate balance of 1) cost for the Exchequer, 2) costs on the consumer, and 3) economy-wide costs,” Stark said. “And we must make use of the right tools - carbon pricing, tax, financial incentives, information or regulation.” Despite such advice, as the FT has noted, the Treasury’s plans for how the cost of reaching net zero will be distributed remain “vague”. The Spectator columnist Ross Clark last week claimed that Tory leaders have “a tradition of refusing to level with the public about the cost of their green ideas”. And Chancellor Rishi Sunak is “understood to be in rebellion against the costs of net zero - whatever they may be”, he wrote. Skip advert One leaked government assessment put the total expenditure at £1trn, according to Clark, who noted that the CCC has been ordered by the Information Tribunal to present the methodology behind its cost calculations, which the advisory body has “never properly explained”. As the Treasury prepares to publish its next net zero review later this year, recent polling suggests that public attitudes to green investment is shifting. Amid growing concern about the effects of climate change, 27% of almost 1,800 people quizzed by YouGov said they would be willing to support policies tackling climate change even if these measures negatively impacted their personal finances.",

An encrypted phone used by criminals around the world to conduct their operations in the shadows had just one flaw: it had been conceived, built, marketed and sold by police, who were monitoring every text exchange. The rain pattered lightly on the harbour of the Belgian port city of Ghent when, on 21 June 2021, a team of professional divers slipped below the surface into the emerald murk. The Brazilian tanker, heavy with fruit juice bound for Australia, had already crossed the Atlantic, but its journey wasn’t halfway done as the divers felt their way along its hull. They were looking for the sea chest, an inlet below the waterline through which the ship draws seawater to cool its engines. Tucked inside, they found what they were hunting for: three long sacks, wrapped in a thick plastic bag. When the Belgian police opened the first, a stack of bricks of cocaine slid out. Had this cargo reached Australia, the haul would have been worth more than A$64m (£34m). Smuggling tens of millions of dollars of Class A drugs across the ocean requires total secrecy and a significant amount of international logistical coordination. But the police knew about the alleged plot thanks to intelligence gleaned from a device that had, since its launch in 2018, become something of a viral sensation in the global underworld. An0m, as it was called, looked like any off-the-shelf smartphone, but it could not be bought in a shop or on a website. First you had to know a guy, then you had to be prepared to pay: $1,700 for the handset with a $1,250 annual subscription, an astonishing price for a phone that was unable to make calls or browse the internet. Almost 10,000 users around the world had agreed to pay, not for the device so much as for an application installed on it. Opening the phone’s calculator allowed users to enter a sum that functioned as a kind of numeric open sesame to launch a secret messaging application. Skip advert The people selling the phone claimed that An0m was the most secure messaging service in the world. Not only was every message encrypted so that it could not be read by a digital eavesdropper, it could be received only by another An0m phone user. Moreover, An0m could not be downloaded from any of the usual app stores. Users’ confidence in An0m was, it seemed, bolstered by some novel functionality included on every device. In the past, phones marketed to hyper security-conscious users were sold with the option to remotely wipe the device’s data. This would enable, say, a smuggler to destroy evidence even after it had been collected. But police had started to use Faraday bags – containers lined with metal that would prevent a phone from receiving a kill signal. The An0m phone came with a workaround: users could set an option to wipe the phone if the device went offline for a specified amount of time. Users could also send voice memos in which the phone would automatically disguise the voice. An0m was the ideal channel to arrange the passage of A$64m of cocaine across the world. It was not, however, a secure phone app at all. Every message sent on the app since its launch in 2018 – 19.37 million of them – had been collected, and many of them read by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) who, with the FBI, had conceived, built and sold the devices. On 7 June 2021, more than 800 arrests were made around the world, all of people who had in some way fallen under suspicion thanks to these devices that sent information to the AFP. In Belgium, two weeks later, the divers did not have to hunt for the sacks of cocaine for long; they knew where to look. Operation Ironside (or Operation Trojan Shield, as it was known in the US) was the largest coordinated law enforcement effort in Australian history. Richard Chin, head of transnational operations in the AFP, had taken to calling 7 June “Big Bang”. If all went to plan, the operation had the potential to reshape the criminal world. Big Bang’s targets constituted an array of underworld figures: mobsters, bikers, neighbourhood drug barons, whose alleged crimes ranged from money laundering to attempted murder. What they had in common was their choice of texting app. Skip advert The scheme was seeded ten years earlier, in Vancouver. There, in 2008, Vincent Ramos, a young entrepreneur who started out as a bathtub salesman, founded Phantom Secure, a telecoms company that promised users absolute privacy. Phantom Secure’s phones were BlackBerries modified to remove the camera, microphone and GPS tracking software, and installed with a remote-wipe feature. Every message sent from one device to another was encrypted and routed through servers in Panama and Hong Kong. (CNN) As Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters a new month, the wealthy elite close to Russian President Vladimir Putin are facing a radically changing set of circumstances far from the frontlines. The invasion prompted Western nations to impose restrictive sanctions on Russian individuals and banking institutions. And while a handful of oligarchs -- those billionaires who made much of their fortunes under the watchful eye of Putin -- have called for peace, many have stayed quiet as nations cut off their access to markets and commerce.

Biden's decision to call for a federal gas tax holiday -- a move once derided as a gimmick by Barack Obama and viewed skeptically by leading economists -- almost certainly won't make it through Congress, especially as it faces blowback from the President's own allies on Capitol Hill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stopped short of endorsing the plan in a statement after Biden's remarks. Biden's proposal would eliminate a federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon of gas through September. The plan would cost $10 billion, but Biden wants to offset the loss of highway revenue. (CNN) President Joe Biden's call for Congress to suspend federal gasoline and diesel taxes will likely land on empty in the Senate. Even if he can get all 50 Democratic senators behind the legislation, he would still need 10 Republicans to join the cause to advance the measure, which seems extremely unlikely. LANSING – Gov.

U.S. President Joe Biden calls for a federal gas tax holiday as he speaks about gas prices during remarks in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building's South Court Auditorium at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 22, 2022. Washington CNN — But consumers don't receive the full benefit of gas tax holidays, according to a recent analysis by the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model, which looked at suspensions in three states through mid-May. Instead, they have to share the savings with gas suppliers, which capture part of the economic benefit if pump prices don't fall by the full amount of the suspended tax. The report quantifies some of the criticism that economists and budget experts have voiced about gas tax holidays. In addition, they argue that temporarily eliminating the tax does not help curb inflation in the long run, since it spurs demand by lowering prices without enhancing supply. Plus, it reduces tax revenue and funding for transportation repairs and infrastructure. President Joe Biden said Monday that he hopes to make a decision about a gas tax holiday by the end of the week, as the administration looks for ways to ease record fuel prices in a midterm election year.

New York (CNN Business) If Russia invades Ukraine, inflation-weary Americans will likely pay even higher prices at the pump . That's because Russia is the No. 2 oil producer on the planet , behind only the United States. And Ukraine is a key energy transit hub, where a large amount of Russian natural gas exports to Europe flow through. Experts Ashley Fly, Grant Wilson and Ljubomir Jankovic assess whether the prime minister is delivering on his climate promises The UK is hosting the 26th annual UN climate summit in Glasgow. Boris Johnson’s government boasts of having the most ambitious climate change targets in the world. But how is the country’s progress to net zero emissions by 2050 going? Three experts look at three key pledges. Transport Pledge: to phase out sales of petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030. Progress: electric vehicles, or EVs, accounted for 15.2% of all new UK vehicle registrations in September 2021, up from an average of 6.6% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2019. There are now almost 100 different EV models to choose from and a growing network of nearly 5,000 rapid chargers, up from 2,000 in 2018. In Norway, a country which is aiming for a more ambitious 2025 ban on petrol and diesel vehicles, nearly 80% of all vehicle sales in September were electric, up from 54.3% in 2020. Norway has demonstrated that a transition to electric vehicles is possible with current technologies if attractive policies, such as EV tax exemptions, are in place. There are lots of hurdles which the UK must overcome to achieve its own 100% EV sales target by 2030, such as households which lack driveways to charge their EVs at home and the commercial van sector, which will also fall under the ban. The government can help by installing more on-street charging points, simplifying the use of rapid charging points so they can all take contactless payment, and working with manufacturers to offer test drives. Electric vans currently qualify for government grants worth up to £6,000, but businesses may need more generous incentives. As the rest of the world rushes to meet their own EV targets, there could be a shortage of materials, parts and skills to make enough to keep up with demand. This could cause the price of EVs to rise or overwhelm waiting lists. One solution is to invest in the UK’s automotive sector and develop a flexible domestic supply chain with a network of gigafactories to produce the millions of batteries needed. Skip advert Overall, the signs are looking good for high levels of EV purchasing in the near future, but it’s not time to take the foot off the zero emission gas just yet. Electricity Pledge: to stop burning coal to generate electricity by 1 October 2024. Progress: the UK’s rapid elimination of coal-fired power since 2015 has been possible due to three factors: a fall in electricity demand, an increase in renewable generation (wind and to a lesser degree solar) and a shift from coal to gas generation. However, there is still a residual amount of coal generation that has supplied between 1% and 2% of electricity demand at an annual level from 2019 to 2021. Coal is on track to generate around six terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity in 2021. The drop in wind generation from 2020 to 2021 alone (largely due to an unusually calm summer) has been around 6-8 TWh. Coal remains a flexible source of generation that can be called upon to fill gaps when other sources are struggling or to help with unforeseen outages. This happened in September when the interconnector cable that imports electricity from France was taken offline due to a fire. A new electrical interconnector to Norway could further reduce the country’s dependence on generation from coal. Energy companies are also introducing time of use tariffs which nudge customers to shift electrical demand away from expensive peak periods such as weekday evenings – when coal is traditionally used to fill short-term gaps in supply – by passing on the higher cost of electricity at these times. The shift from coal is merely a step towards fully decarbonising the electrical system. The next is to remove natural gas. It’s entirely plausible that Britain will remove coal-generated electricity by October 2024, but keeping it out will depend on finding low-carbon means of balancing electricity supply and demand. That will mean making the electrical system more resilient to shocks, such as the sudden loss of power or high demand. EVs can help, by supplying electricity back to the grid when needed – effectively acting as small, distributed batteries. But by the time meaningful levels of controllable demand (and potentially supply) from EV charging are available to the system, coal generation will be long gone. Skip advert The other major challenge is balancing the system between seasons and years. Britain uses much more energy in winter than summer. As more energy generation (as well as demand) becomes dependent on the weather, Britain will have to prepare for years with significantly lower output from wind in particular. Coal excels here, with cost-effective stockpiles which can be turned into months of electricity supply. Batteries, pumped water and other forms of short-term electrical storage will never reach these sorts of scales. Without coal, energy system operators must find low-carbon solutions to this challenge of seasonal balancing. It will be surprising if coal generation lasts quite as long as October 2024 in Britain, and the milestone is one that should be rightly celebrated when it happens. However, the longer term storage that coal provided (and gas and nuclear still do) is something that Britain’s needs to address for a low-carbon electrical sector that is resilient to sustained low wind weather events. Heating Pledge: to ensure all new heating systems installed in UK homes are low-carbon from 2035. In October last year, during the run-up to the Cop26 climate change conference, the UK government announced plans to subsidise the introduction of low-carbon heat pumps in order to cut reliance on fossil-fuel heating. As part of a “home heating revolution” in Britain, the government set out plans to start phasing out gas boilers by offering £5,000 grants to help 90,000 households install home heat pumps, The Guardian said. For 50 years the gas boiler has been “the mainstay of central heating”, said The Times. “Its days, however, are numbered” as new gas-reliant boilers will be banned from UK homes by 2035. Although the government is considering a number of green alternatives to heat homes, including the use of hydrogen boilers, the most “viable” alternative for the majority of households will be electric-powered heat pumps. Climate change is not the only crisis that Britain is battling – there’s also the cost of living crisis, too. The three-year boiler upgrade scheme will help “reduce the cost of more environmentally-friendly heating systems”, the BBC reported. And in his Spring Statement last month, Chancellor Rishi Sunak also announced that households will now pay 0% VAT on energy-saving equipment such as heat pumps and solar panels. With energy bills going through the roof, can households afford to make the switch from gas boilers to heat pumps? What are heat pumps and how do they work? An electric heat pump works like “a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air, the ground or a nearby water source before concentrating the heat and transferring it indoors”, The Guardian explained. Heat pumps are “nothing new”, said The Times, but very few are installed each year – roughly 27,000. The number of heat pumps being installed in UK homes will have to be scaled up considerably, with Boris Johnson’s climate advisers recommending that “by 2030 there should be 5.5 million heat pumps in British homes”. Skip advert Heat pumps work even when outside temperatures are very low and near freezing. They are also “much more efficient than a gas boiler” as they are able to produce “around three times the energy they use”, said the i news site. “Crucially, heat pumps are also clean”, The Times added. Gas-reliant boilers produce masses of carbon dioxide: the gas boilers in British homes “produce twice as much CO2 as the nation’s gas-fired power stations”. But if we can ensure the electricity used to power heat pumps comes from “truly green sources” then “water is the only byproduct” of using a heat pump. How much do heat pumps cost to install? The cost of installing a heat pump can be significant and depends on the type installed and the size of a property, the BBC said. The installation can also prove to be “difficult and expensive”. For example, you may need to install “bigger radiators or dig into floors”. Heat pump prices are “usually high, taking into account the installation”, said GreenMatch.co.uk. The typical price range for a complete installation is “between £8,000 and £45,000, to which the running costs have to be considered”. The cost for an air to water heat pump range from £7,000 to £18,000, while ground source heat pumps can cost up to £45,000. “The running costs of heat pumps depend on your household, its insulation properties and size.” What grants are available and who is eligible? Through the boiler upgrade scheme, government grants will be provided to encourage property owners to install low-carbon heating systems such as heat pumps, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy explained. The scheme is open to domestic and small non-domestic properties in England and Wales and runs from 2022 to 2025. “These grants will help property owners overcome the upfront cost of low carbon heating technologies.” From 1 April, if the installation and system set-up of a low-carbon heating system is completed then support will be entitled under the scheme. From 11 April installers will be able to open an account for the scheme with administrator Ofgem, and from 23 May the scheme opens for grant applications and payments. Entitlements include: £5,000 off the cost and installation of an air source heat pump London (CNN Business) Europe has given itself just five years to break its addiction to Russian oil and gas . European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Friday that EU leaders had agreed to spend the next two months drafting proposals for eliminating the bloc's dependency on Russian energy imports by 2027. Power stations in space sounds like an idea from science fiction – and in fact it is an idea from science fiction: in 1941, Isaac Asimov’s story Reason described a space station that transmits energy collected from the Sun to other planets using microwave beams. Today, the technology required to do this exists, and space-based solar power (SBSP) is being taken seriously. The idea is that a vast satellite, miles in length, would generate electricity via thousands of photovoltaic panels. This would then be transmitted to Earth using high-frequency radio waves. On the ground, this beam of microwave energy would be intercepted by a field of ellipse-shaped radio antennae, converted into electricity, and distributed to the grid. For four years after the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, western powers decided against intervention as ethnic conflict gripped Bosnia. More than 100,000 people were killed during the 1992-95 war, which led to mass murder on a scale not witnessed in Europe since the Second World War. Now, a quarter of a century on from the peace deal that ended the war, those powers are again being confronted by the potential for deadly sectarian fighting. The latest Liz Truss is meeting members of Bosnia’s multiethnic armed forces in Sarajevo today during a visit to underline the UK’s continuing commitment to peace in the Western Balkans. The foreign secretary is also unveiling plans to deepen “security and economic partnership with Bosnia in the face of secessionists and Russian attempts to influence and destabilise”, the Foreign Office said in a statement. These plans include a bid “to mobilise $100m of UK-backed investment in the Western Balkans by 2025”. Addressing military personnel at Sarajevo’s Army Hall, Truss was due to warn that Russia’s aggression “cannot be appeased” and that Bosnia’s “future lies in sovereignty and self-determination, in greater partnership with Nato and countries like the UK”. Sarajevo last month called for Nato to accelerate its bid to become a member of the alliance in order to preserve regional security following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Bosnia’s Defence Minister Sifet Podzic told Al Jazeera that his country was participating in the Membership Action Plan, which he described as “the last step before gaining [Nato] membership”. But if the alliance insisted that Bosnia “fulfils all criteria”, he warned, gaining membership “will take a while”, because “we will need a lot of time to modernise our army”. Uneasy truce The Bosnian War was triggered when Bosnia and Herzegovina joined several republics of the former Yugoslavia and declared independence. After three and a half years of bloodshed, the conflict was ended by the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Skip advert By early 2008, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia had convicted 45 Serbs, 12 Croats, and four Bosniaks of war crimes committed during the war. Many thousands of Bosniaks and Croats died in concentration camps run by Serb forces at sites including Omarska and Trnopolje. But the Srebrenica massacre, in which 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were murdered, was the most notorious act of genocide. Better known as the Dayton Accords, the peace deal saw the majority Muslim Bosniaks and Serb separatists, who fought under the flag of the Republika Srpska, agree to a single sovereign state. But in what The Washington Post described as “a complex compromise”, this state was divided into two parts: the largely Serb-populated Republika Srpska and mainly Croat-Bosniak-populated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The deal “reestablished Bosnia as a unified state and granted the right of return for victims of ethnic cleansing”, a move that ran contrary to the “wishes of Serb and Croat ultra-nationalists”, the paper continued. But it also “adopted ethnic federal structures recognising Republika Srpska as a political entity with self-governing rights”, something Bosniaks opposed. The uneasy peace has been maintained ever since. But a report by UN High Representative Christian Schmidt in November warned that threats by Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of the presidency as part of a triumvirate power-sharing agreement, to “pull out of state-level institutions” is ”tantamount to secession”. The suggestion that Serbs could form their own military “endangers not only the peace and stability of the country and the region, but – if unanswered by the international community – could lead to the undoing of the [Dayton] agreement itself”, Schmidt wrote in his first report since becoming Bosnian overseer. A splintering of the military “into two or more armies” would mean “the level of international military presence would require reassessment”, he added. “A lack of response to the current situation would endanger the [Dayton Accord], while instability in BiH would have wider regional implications.” ‘Shopping spree’ Schmidt’s report came shortly after Bosnian Serb police held what they described as an “anti-terrorist” drill just outside the capital Sarajevo. The move was “seen by many as another provocation by the Serb separatist leadership”, reported Al Jazeera. Skip advert The exercise took place on 22 October in a ski resort at Mount Jahorina, an “area from where the Bosnian Serb military relentlessly shelled and sniped Sarajevo” during the conflict three decades ago. The drill “involved armoured vehicles, helicopters, and special police force personnel in camouflage uniforms and armed with assault rifles”, the broadcaster added, and prompted the EU peacekeeping force that has remained in the country since the 1990s to deploy “an aircraft to monitor the exercise”.

Gregory Korte, and Liz Szabo USA TODAY Scottsdale joined other metro Phoenix cities in mid-March that declared states of emergency to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. Scottsdale, with arguably the Valley's hottest restaurant and bar scene, stopped short of shuttering or restricting those businesses.

Will the Tampa Bay Lightning take their first step toward a third consecutive Stanley Cup or will the Toronto Maple Leafs pick up their first playoff series win since 2004? Will the Edmonton Oilers get their first playoff win since Todd McLellan coached the team or will McLellan's Los Angeles Kings stop them? The Tampa Bay Lightning are heading to the Stanley Cup Final for the third consecutive season and the reward is starting on the road again against the Western Conference’s top regular-season team. The way the two-time defending champions beat the New York Rangers 2-1 in Game 6 will help them when they face the Colorado Avalanche in Game 1 on Wednesday (8 p.m. ET, ABC). The Colorado Avalanche reached the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since their 2001 championship on Monday, shredding their reputation of a highly talented team that disappointed in the playoffs. They staged a furious third-period comeback and won in overtime on a goal by trade deadline acquisition Artturi Lehkonen to sweep the Edmonton Oilers with a 6-5 victory in Game 4. Lehkonen, then with Montreal, also got the Canadiens into the Final last season with an overtime goal. Eric Staal, who won a gold medal with Canada in 2010 and didn't go in 2014, had little chance of making the 2022 team. He was an unsigned free agent and Canada has enough talent to field multiple teams of NHL players. But his fortunes changed when the NHL dropped out of the Olympics in December amid a surge in COVID-19 cases. DENVER – The two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning are well-schooled in the art of erasing deficits. They came within 11 minutes of elimination by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round. They spotted two games to the New York Rangers to open the Eastern Conference final. Even in a Game 1 Stanley Cup Final loss to the Colorado Avalanche, they staggered in the face of a first-period barrage, but quickly pulled even before falling in overtime. The Vegas Golden Knights had denied an ESPN report last week that goaltender Robin Lehner would have season-ending surgery and he was the backup Sunday night. Monday, though, the team announced that Lehner would have shoulder surgery and be out for the team's remaining games and the playoffs, if Vegas makes it. The Colorado Avalanche are Stanley Cup champions for the first time since 2001, thanks to a resiliency that had eluded them in recent years. The Avalanche tied an NHL record with their 10th come-from-behind victory of the playoffs to beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 2-1 in Game 6 Sunday night and end the two-time champions' reign. The Stanley Cup playoffs start Monday and the biggest question is whether the Tampa Bay Lightning can become the first team since the 1980s New York Islanders to win three Stanley Cups in a row. At times, it looked like the answer might be no. They had a 2-6 slide in March and lost four in a row in April. Nikita Kucherov had one goal in 15 games and Steven Stamkos had an eight-game goal drought. Goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy wasn't as dominant.

        "context": "(CNN) Multiple polls conducted since the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade find that broad majorities of the public disapprove and suggest that in the immediate aftermath of the ruling, the decision could be more motivational for Democrats than Republicans. In a new Monmouth University survey released on Tuesday, 60% of US adults disapprove of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, with just 37% approving. There's also a significant intensity gap: 53% of Americans strongly disapprove of the ruling, including 84% of Democrats, compared with 29% who strongly approve, including 58% of Republicans. Washington (CNN) A majority of Americans -- 54% -- now say they disapprove of the job the Supreme Court is doing following the leak of the draft opinion showing the justices are poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, according to a new poll released Wednesday The Marquette Law School poll findings represent a dramatic change from how Americans viewed the court in March, the last time the survey was conducted. Then, 54% of respondents said they approved of the nine justices and 45% said they disapproved. Now, only 44% approve. (CNN) Americans remain broadly opposed to overturning the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS , following the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that would strike down the landmark ruling. Sixty-six percent say Roe v. Wade should not be completely struck down, and 59% would support Congress passing legislation to establish a nationwide right to abortion, including 81% of Democrats, 65% of independents and 30% of Republicans, the survey finds. (CNN) Most Americans oppose overturning the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade precedent, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, with a majority saying that if the decision was vacated, they'd want to see their own state move toward more permissive abortion laws. Just 30% of Americans say they'd like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn its Roe vs. Wade decision, with 69% opposed -- a finding that's largely consistent both with other recent polling and with historical trends. In a set of three surveys taken last autumn by different pollsters, support for overturning Roe vs. Wade stood between 20% and 31%, depending on the precise framing of the question. And in CNN's polling dating back to 1989, the share of the public in favor of completely overturning Roe has never risen above 36%. (CNN) Where do Americans stand on abortion rights? It's a simple and important question, especially in light of the recent leak of a draft US Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade , but one that is far from easy to answer. Issue polling in general is tricky, and the issue of abortion rights is particularly hard to poll. While it does seem that more Americans want the procedure to be legal than not, people on all sides of the issue can find something they like in the polling on abortion. About 44% of Americans approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing, according to the new poll. That number is down 10 percentage points from March, when the poll was last conducted. (CNN) When three red states finalized severe restrictions on abortion over consecutive days last week, they highlighted the GOP's rising militancy on the issue -- and the political and legal calculations underpinning it. Separate actions last week in Oklahoma, Florida and Kentucky made clear the red state drive to retrench, or eliminate, access to abortion is escalating as the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority nears a decision, expected in late June, in which it is widely anticipated to overturn Roe v. Wade , the landmark 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. I covered the political impact in part in a prior column . But the court's actions in this case may do something more than just affect the elections this year. The Supreme Court's own reputation is at stake , and the decision to get rid of Roe v. Wade and to upset the status quo comes at a very sensitive time for the justices in a different court: the one of public opinion. Craig Gilbert and Richard Wolf A majority of Americans disapprove of President Donald Trump’s handling of appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court and doubt he would pick the “right kind of person” to fill the next opening on the high court, according to a new and wide-ranging national survey about the court by the Marquette University Law School. WASHINGTON – Nearly two-thirds of Americans say the Supreme Court should uphold its decision in the historic Roe v. Wade case that ruled abortion access was a constitutional right, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. The poll, conducted Nov. 7-10, found 60% of Americans believe Roe should be upheld, versus 27% who believe the high court should overturn that landmark decision.",

Americans who want to stay socially distant during the COVID-19 pandemic now have another reason to think twice before going out for gas. Several states have increased gas taxes in recent months to make up for sudden shortfalls in revenue devoted to road repairs. As Americans drive less during the pandemic due partly to social distancing and remote work arrangements, gasoline demand has fallen. That's one key factor triggering the tax increases as lawmakers seek to limit the impact of lower revenue on road repair budgets. Has chicken flown the coop? The nation's chicken wars and cravings for comfort food during the pandemic have made poultry so scarce and expensive that some restaurants are limiting or running out of chicken sandwiches, wings and tenders.

Trader Joe's, Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco and Publix were among the first to confirm updates to mask requirements, leading the way for mask-free shopping, though customers who live in areas that have state or local mask requirements may still have to wear them – regardless of vaccination status. In some cases, vaccinated store employees can also go to work without a mask.

Staff and wire reports LONDON — Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II and her family are facing a 35 million pound ($45 million) hit from the coronavirus pandemic, partly due to a shortage of tourists, the monarch’s money-manager said Friday. The claim: The U.K. government only just finished paying its debts to slave owners in 2015 Recent fatal police shootings in the United States have led to a global reckoning on the role of race and injustice in society. In the United Kingdom, this dispute has centered on the country's imperial history and legacy of slavery. Meghan findings won’t be published Buckingham Palace has refused to release the findings of an investigation into bullying allegations made against the Duchess of Sussex. The review was launched in March 2021 to explore what “lessons could be learned” after it was alleged that she had driven out two personal assistants and “humiliated” staff. Although the palace initially said that any changes in policies or procedures recommended by the review would be published, a source has now said that those taking part needed to have “confidentiality”. The disgraced duke had faced “increasing pressure” from the Royal Family to settle and bring the case to an end after it “threatened to overshadow the Queen’s jubilee celebrations ”, according to The Times . Prince Charles, his older brother, is thought to have been a particularly “prominent voice” on the matter. But in reaching the settlement he agreed to make a “substantial donation” to Giuffre’s charity for victims of abuse, pledging to “demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein” by supporting the “fight against the evils of sex trafficking and by supporting its victims”. Danica Kirka Associated Press It's been six months since Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan moved to Southern California to build a new kind of royal lifestyle, one bolstered by more independence, more control over their image and new Hollywood business partners. So, Harry and Meg, how's it going so far? What is being proposed? In July, the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace formally announced plans for a new national flagship to “promote British businesses around the world”. Commissioned at a cost of £200m to £250m, it would be designed and built in the UK. Boris Johnson said it would reflect “the UK’s burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation”. The boat is to be a replacement for the Royal Yacht Britannia, which reached the end of its working life in 1997. The idea, first proposed in 2001, was taken up by Tory MPs in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, and has received vociferous backing from The Daily Telegraph. It was supported by Johnson after he became PM, and given the go-ahead in May. The Government said it would be used to host trade fairs, ministerial meetings and diplomatic summits. The vessel would be crewed by the Royal Navy, and is expected to be in service for about 30 years. Aimee Picchi Special to USA TODAY",

Some cities have decided to cancel their pyrotechnic displays, while others have chosen to continue them. Dry vegetation and a lack of rainfall have led to a megadrought for more than 75% of the West and parts of the Central US, including Colorado. Now first responders and other officials are warning the public about the risk of Fourth of July fireworks. As cities and households around the country gear up to celebrate the 246th birthday of the United States of America, some shows promise to put on bigger and better firework displays than ever before. For many Americans today, fireworks are often accompanied with a day of other Fourth of July related activities, but the tradition of sending bright flares into the sky has been around since the very first Independence Day in 1776, according to the American Pyrotechnics Association (APA). Despite some supply-chain issues that have caused fireworks cancellations and rescheduled some Independence Day events, most metro Phoenix cities will celebrate the Fourth of July with pyrotechnics shows this year. For the third year in a row, Phoenix will not host any Independence Day celebrations. This is due to \"supply chain issues affecting access to fireworks,\" according to the city's news release. And with Chase Field's ongoing roof issues, the annual postgame fireworks spectacular in downtown Phoenix will not be taking place after the Diamondbacks-Giants games, either. (CNN) Fourth of July weekend is approaching, and most of the United States will see rain chances through Monday. As airports fill up with the most travelers in years , widespread showers and thunderstorms are likely to impact air travel in some areas, causing delays and cancellations. The southern US will see the most exceptional rain, with the heaviest chances Saturday. The Northeast will see thunderstorms during peak weekend travel on Friday and Saturday afternoon. And besides monsoon thunderstorms, dry conditions creating severe drought in the Southwest will pose a threat for wildfires. Cue the sparklers!

(CNN) Rarely have Americans been so divided on what their country stands for as on the 246th anniversary of independence . As red, white and blue fireworks burst in air on Monday night, politics may not be at the forefront of most people's minds. Fourth of July fireworks celebrations will return this year — weather permitting — after being canceled or postponed last year during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Treasure Coast residents didn’t have any public displays of fireworks on Independence Day 2020. Sebastian postponed its fireworks display to Labor Day weekend while Fort Pierce postponed its fireworks show to New Year’s Eve. Last year, Frostproof was one of the few Polk County cities where residents could celebrate the Fourth of July as a community. In 2020, most cities across the country canceled Independence Day celebrations and fireworks displays to discourage large crowds and slow the spread of COVID-19. But the party went on in Frostproof, said Vice-Mayor Austin Gravley. After a year of canceled parades and virtual events, many cities in central Ohio plan to bring their Fourth of July celebrations back with a bang. While the largest fireworks show in the state will be missing — Red, White and Boom in Columbus may be rescheduled for late summer or the fall, officials say — there are plenty of others where locals can show their spirit.

In the United States, leading public health officials say they are \"very carefully\" monitoring if or when fourth doses might be needed. Israel was the first nation to roll out fourth doses , announcing in December that adults 60 and older, medical workers and people with suppressed immune systems were eligible to receive the extra shot if at least four months have passed since their third dose. On Thursday, the rapid outbreak of coronavirus prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a level 4 travel advisory (\"Do not travel\") – its most severe warning – for the entire country of China, one week after it did so for Hubei Province, where the virus' epicenter, Wuhan, is located. The move followed the World Health Organization's decision to declare coronavirus, which Chinese officials say has been diagnosed in 9,800 people and killed 213 , a global health emergency. At first, the impact of the novel coronavirus to Iowa was minor. State public health officials suggested Iowans practice good personal hygiene to stop the spread of the virus. Officials said the risk was low for contracting the respiratory illness that can be mild in some people but serious in others. The few Iowans who had been tested for the virus didn't have it.",

Embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa arrived in Singapore on a flight from Maldives on Thursday, according to a high-ranking security source in Colombo. He had been in Maldives for just over 24 hours after fleeing Sri Lanka's commercial capital on Wednesday -- the same day he was meant to resign after he pledged to step down following huge protests against his rule at the weekend. Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) For three straight nights last week, Upul took to the streets of Sri Lanka's capital city holding a candle or a placard as he protested the country's worst economic crisis in decades. Like his neighbors, he was frustrated by the more than 10-hour power cuts that plunged Colombo into darkness, and a shortage of gas to cook with that made it hard for his family to eat. Disabled man dies at Gatwick A disabled man left waiting on a plane died at Gatwick’s Airport after getting off without a helper. The Sun said the passenger became “the first victim of Britain’s airport chaos” after he fell to his death from an escalator. The tabloid said the man had been waiting for assistance from an EasyJet flight but became frustrated by delays, prompting him to leave the plane into the packed terminal, where the accident occurred. Gatwick said “staff shortages were not a factor in this incident” and “an investigation is under way”. When Barb Mozdzen opened last month's school board meeting in Chandler, Arizona, for public comment, she had a caveat.

At least three others were injured and taken to hospitals after rioters, many waving Trump flags and wearing Trump garb, breached security at the Capitol building and swarmed the area. The breach prompted an evacuation of the Senate chamber and a 3 1/2-hour lockdown before officials declared the building was secure.

The package, which will be drawn from existing Defense Department stocks, also includes 18 patrol boats for monitoring coasts and rivers, and small arms. Washington (CNN) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky virtually address ed members of Congress on Wednesday to press the United States for more assistance as his country attempts to counter Russia's invasion. Afterward, President Joe Biden detailed the latest aid package, which includes both defensive equipment and lethal weapons. The last time Russia invaded Ukraine, then-President Petro Poroshenko also addressed a joint session of Congress and famously said in 2014 that \"one cannot win the war with blankets,\" as part of an emotional plea for help arming his troops. In response, the Obama administration announced $46 million in security assistance to Ukraine, which included body armor and night vision goggles but no lethal aid. (CNN) The Senate voted Thursday to pass a roughly $40 billion bill to send aid to Ukraine as the country fights back against Russia's brutal and unprovoked attacks . The measure passed the House earlier this month and will now go to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. The final tally in the Senate was 86 to 11. (CNN) For the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US is providing Kyiv with the types of high-power capabilities some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago. The $800 million list is driven not only by direct requests from Ukraine, but also in preparation for a new type of fight on the open plains of southeast Ukraine right next to Russia, terrain that plays into Russia's natural military advantages. Washington (CNN) The US is prepping another $800 million military assistance package for Ukraine, according to three senior administration officials and two sources familiar with the planning. Details of the latest package are still being privately discussed and could change, but earlier Tuesday, President Joe Biden said the US plans to send more artillery to Ukraine. (CNN) President Joe Biden on Thursday asked Congress for a $33 billion supplemental funding bill aimed at supporting Ukraine over the next several months as Russia's brutal and unrelenting war enters a new phase. In another significant request, Biden outlined a proposal that would further pressure Russian oligarchs over the war in Ukraine , including using money from their seized assets to fund Ukraine's defense. Since August, U.S. military aid to help Ukraine repel Russia has surpassed $3 billion under Biden. The aid has provided more than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems and some 5,500 Javelin missiles. Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine as he sought to answer his Ukrainian counterpart's impassioned call for help and leadership delivered to Congress earlier in the day. \"The world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make (Russian President Vladimir) Putin pay a very heavy price,\" Biden said before signing a presidential memorandum at the White House to deliver the military assistance. \"America is leading this effort, together with our allies and partners, providing an enormous level of security and humanitarian assistance that we're adding to today and we're going to continue to do more in the days and weeks ahead.\" Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Wednesday, March 16.

        "context": "New York (CNN Business) Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a major reason that US drivers are paying record prices for gasoline . But it's not the only cause of the spike. Numerous factors are pushing prices up, with regular gasoline hitting a record $4.87 a gallon Monday according to AAA's survey — up 25 cents a gallon in just the last week. Inflation hit a fresh 39-year high in December. The consumer price index jumped 7% last year, the fastest pace since 1982. Both before and after Russia's invasion of Ukraine contributed to a spike in US gas prices , various Republicans bashed President Joe Biden for abandoning Trump-era \"energy independence.\" These Republicans have fostered the impression that the \"energy independent\" US did not need energy from Russia and elsewhere under Trump, but then, under Biden, has been forced to buy this foreign energy once more. The truth is that the US was never close to genuine independence from foreign energy in the Trump era. Stan Choe and Alex Veiga The Associated Press New York (CNN Business) After more than a month of surging prices, Tuesday brought some modest -- very modest -- relief to drivers. The average price of a gallon of regular gas fell to $4.32 a gallon, down from $4.33 a gallon Monday, according to AAA. Even at just nine-tenths of a cent, it was the biggest single-day decline in gas prices since August 2021. New York (CNN Business) President Joe Biden is using his bully pulpit to call out the tendency for gasoline prices to go up like a rocket when oil spikes, but only drop like a feather when crude crashes. Biden fired off a tweet Wednesday morning highlighting the painfully slow decline in gasoline prices in a bid to draw scrutiny to a decades-long trend that critics say hurts consumers by failing to pass savings along to drivers. Consumers will likely continue seeing record gas prices this summer. EU's plan to ban Russian oil will crimp already shallow supplies. The national average cost for a regular gallon of gas may reach an all-time high this week. The higher prices at the pump can be attributed to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Consumers should get used to higher prices on goods and services. Once those prices rise, the new prices typically stick.

The Washburn Fire has swelled to nearly 500 acres as it burns near the lower portion of Mariposa Grove, Yosemite park officials said. Firefighters are working from the ground and air to suppress the blaze, and park officials said the grove will remain closed until further notice. A wildfire burning through thick forests shuttered Yosemite National Park's largest grove of iconic giant sequoia trees over the weekend and once again endangered some of the world's largest trees. The threat of flames from the Washburn Fire led to the closing of the grove Friday and to the evacuation of hundreds of people nearby in the community of Wawona, according to the National Park Service. No injuries were reported. (CNN) Fire crews are working to steer a growing wildfire away from Yosemite National Park's legendary giant sequoias, taking protective measures like installing a sprinkler system to dampen the ground around one of the park's most famous trees. While officials say the trees have avoided significant damage so far, the 2,340-acre Washburn Fire doubled in size over the weekend, entering Yosemite's Mariposa Grove, where more than 500 giant sequoias -- some thought to be more than 2,000 years old -- can tower to more than 20 stories.

Yosemite National Park's largest and most iconic sequoia grove remained threatened by a wildfire Sunday afternoon as rough terrain and hot weather proved difficult for battling the blaze. The Washburn Fire was first reported Thursday in Yosemite's Mariposa Grove, which houses over 500 mature sequoias, including the 3,000-year-old Grizzly Giant. It quickly spread amid hot and dry weather conditions: the fire grew to 2,000 acres Sunday evening, up from 466 acres recorded on Friday, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group. Iconic sequoia trees that tower over millions of captivated visitors at Yosemite National Park each year are under threat from a fast-moving fire.

Yosemite National Park's centuries-old sequoia grove was mostly out of danger Thursday, though firefighters warned a risk remains for any fire until it's 100% controlled. \"Mariposa Grove is in a very good place.

A rush of international travelers headed into the United States Monday as the COVID-19 travel ban ended and people from dozens of countries begin flooding in, more than 600 days since they were barred from entry. That's more than 86 weeks. Nearly 20 months. Enough time for grandchildren to be born, or for couples to lose track of the number of nights they fell asleep to FaceTime calls with their partner.

(CNN) The world feared the worst when a worrying new coronavirus variant emerged in late November and ripped through South Africa at a pace not seen before in the pandemic. But two months later, with Omicron dominant across much of the globe, the narrative has shifted for some.

The cost for a gallon of gas in the United States continues to reach all-time highs, as the national average jumped nearly 7 cents Thursday morning. After rising dramatically following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the price of gas reached a record, topping a high that had stood for nearly 14 years. As of Tuesday morning, the average national price for a gallon of regular gasoline touched $4.17, according to AAA, the highest price ever, not accounting for inflation. That was up from $4.07 on Monday and $3.61 a week earlier. New York (CNN Business) For the first time ever, a gallon of regular gas now costs $5 on average nationwide, according to AAA's Saturday reading. The record is hardly a surprise. Gas prices have been rising steadily for the last eight weeks, and this latest milestone marks the 15th straight day that the AAA reading has hit a record price, and the 32nd time in the last 33 days. The national average price for gas has topped $4 a gallon for the first time in over a decade as gas costs continue to soar in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As of Sunday afternoon, the national average of a regular gallon of gas was $4.009, according to AAA. That's up 8 cents from Saturday and up 40 cents from last week. The U.S. hit the $4 national average a day earlier than analysts expected. The national average cost for a regular gallon of gas may reach an all-time high this week. The higher prices at the pump can be attributed to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Get ready to pay even more at the pump – perhaps as much as $5 per gallon or more. Some consumers are already paying more than that: The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in San Francisco hit the $5 mark Thursday.

The US average for the price of a gallon of regular gas hit $4.99 according to the most recent reading from AAA Friday. It marked the 14th straight day, and the 31st time in the last 32 that gas has set a record in America. Gas prices have climbed 39 cents, or 8%, just in the two weeks since the start of the Memorial Day weekend kicked off the traditional summer driving season. Gas prices were already high, but overnight they went up 11 cents, approaching the $4 per-gallon average nationwide. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline rose to $3.84 on Friday, up from $3.73 on Thursday, according to AAA. That comes after another 11-cent increase between Monday and Thursday. One day after the record for the average cost of gas nationwide was broken, prices at the pump continued to climb on Wednesday, jumping an average of 8 cents. The national average for a regular gallon of gas is now $4.25, according to AAA. On Tuesday, the cost was $4.17, breaking the July 2008 record of $4.11, which would be around $5.25 today when adjusted for inflation.

        "context": "(CNN) A former Trump White House official said then-President Donald Trump initially refused to tweet the words \"stay peaceful\" as the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, was escalating. As a violent pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and sent lawmakers scrambling for their lives, Trump tweeted at 2:38 p.m. ET that day: \"Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!\" The tweet came 20 minutes after Trump supporters were smashing through windows and evacuations of lawmakers had begun. WASHINGTON – The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol chronicled at its Thursday hearing what was happening in Congress and at the White House during the 187 minutes between then-President Donald Trump’s fiery speech and his video encouraging the mob to go home. Committee members have argued that Trump’s lack of response was a dereliction of duty under the Constitution to protect Congress. Washington (CNN) Within minutes of the US Capitol breach on January 6, 2021, messages began pouring into the cell phone of White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Among those texting were Republican members of Congress, former members of the Trump administration, GOP activists, Fox personalities -- even the President's son. Their texts all carried the same urgent plea: President Donald Trump needed to immediately denounce the violence and tell the mob to go home. \"He's got to condem (sic) this shit. Asap,\" Donald Trump Jr. texted at 2:53 p.m. That's the period of a little more than three hours as the riot unfolded in the US Capitol that the House select committee has argued then-President Donald Trump was derelict in his duties. The committee says it plans to show, minute-by-minute, how Trump failed to make any effort to tell the rioters to leave the Capitol or to try to help lawmakers -- and then-Vice President Mike Pence -- as they were forced to flee the House and Senate chambers. In the previous hearings, the committee has sought to tie Trump to the violence at the Capitol, showing how he was warned by his aides that his claims the election was stolen were baseless and that there was a risk of violence on January 6, 2021. The committee's final hearing in this series will attempt to illustrate how the former President \"refused to act to defend the Capitol as a violent mob stormed the Capitol,\" according to committee aides. WASHINGTON – House impeachment managers on Thursday argued former President Donald Trump's actions not only fueled the violent assault on the Capitol in the months leading up to the Jan. 6 attack, but that he stood by as the riot raged and showed no remorse in aftermath, which left five people dead. Through a series of audio and video clips from security footage – some of which were previously undisclosed – as well as rioters' social media accounts documenting the day, House impeachment managers prosecuting Trump argued that the former president failed to act as a mob forced their way inside the building and hunted for congressional leaders. (CNN) A federal judge in Washington, DC, questioned former President Donald Trump 's actions during his speech on January 6, 2021, as he considers for the first time whether Trump is immune from liability related to his supporters attacking the US Capitol . During a court hearing Monday, Judge Amit Mehta pointed out repeatedly that Trump on January 6 asked the crowd to march to the Capitol, but that he didn't speak up for two hours asking people to stop the violence. (CNN) The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021 US Capitol attack held its first prime-time hearing Thursday evening, detailing the findings of the panel's investigation and playing new video from closed-door depositions of members of former President Donald Trump's team and depicting the violence at the Capitol. Thursday's hearing was the first in a series this month that will highlight the findings of the panel's investigation, which included interviews with more than 1,000 people about how Trump and his team tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election on multiple fronts. (CNN) Thursday's hearing from the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection will be all about former Vice President Mike Pence , who was at the center of former President Donald Trump's last-ditch effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election on January 6, 2021. Committee aides said the hearing would make the case that Trump's pressure campaign against Pence had \"directly contributed\" to the violence on January 6, which placed Pence's life in danger as rioters chanted, \" Hang Mike Pence .\" Hutchinson has cooperated extensively with the investigation, having sat for four closed-door depositions. She revealed how then-President Donald Trump and his inner circle were warned about the potential for violence on January 6, and how Trump wanted to join the throngs of his supporters at the US Capitol. The testimony bolstered the narrative that the committee has been driving toward over the last few weeks: That Trump incited and supported the insurrection as part of a desperate power grab to steal a second term, and that many of his top advisers thought his schemes were illegal. (CNN) President Joe Biden on Thursday marked the first anniversary of the January 6 insurrection by forcefully calling out former President Donald Trump for attempting to undo American democracy, saying such an insurrection must never happen again. Biden vowed to defend the nation's founding ideals from the threats posed by the violent mob that stormed the Capitol one year ago and the prevailing lies that Trump and his allies continue to repeat about the 2020 election. An animated Biden made one of the most passionate addresses of his still-young presidency as he harkened back to critical moments from the nation's past, casting the assault as a living symbol of the inflection point in American history he so often speaks about.",

Scores of major incidents were announced by fire brigades across the country as blazes broke out in the 40C-plus heatwave. France’s wine industry had already been hit by forecasts that this year’s harvest could be “the smallest vintage for at least 50 years”, Decanter reported earlier this month. Now vineyards in the south-east of the country are assessing the damage from “heartbreaking” wildfires. A blaze broke out last week in the Var region, located between Provence and the French Riviera, which forced thousands of people to evacuate. Spread by strong winds, the wildfires were mostly in forests, but several rosé wine-growing areas were also badly affected, the BBC reported.

Woodburn, Australia (CNN) Ken Morrison has twice been up to his neck in water during climate disasters . The first time, in 2007, he was trapped in a pool with a towel over his head as wildfires ripped through Australia's Hunter Valley , a wine-growing region about three hours' drive north of Sydney. Angelo Young and John Harrington 24/7 Wall Street The doling out of honours in the UK is never short of controversy. And the latest announcement is no different after critics responded with disbelief to the news that former education secretary Gavin Williamson is to receive a knighthood. “Headteachers and education union leaders expressed shock and surprise” when Downing Street yesterday said that the Queen had approved the honour for “political and public service”, The Telegraph reported. Explaining the unusual timing of the announcement, one government source told the paper it had been planned for the New Year Honours list but had been “delayed” after Williamson became entangled in the “Partygate” scandal. The question of whether the honours system is open to financial or other influence has haunted British public life for decades. Here are some of the most bitter disputes over honours in recent UK political history: Lloyd George’s ‘cash for patronage’ scandal David Lloyd George enjoyed an illustrious political career, including serving as prime minister from 1916 to 1922. But the Liberal PM found himself embroiled in a major “cash for patronage” scandal over his resignation honours list in 1922. Although the purchase of peerages was not illegal, Lloyd George was accused of raising funds for his party through the sale of peerages, as well as using the honours system to (unsuccessfully) avoid criticism from newspapers. It was the brazenness of Lloyd George’s “price list for peerages” that caused a scandal. They were arranged through political fixer Maundy Gregory, who sold peerages “ranging from £10,000 (more than £400,000 today) for a knighthood up to £40,000 for a baronetcy”, according to The Guardian. From 1917 to 1922, more than “120 hereditary peers alone were created”, said The Spectator. So many knighthoods were given out in Cardiff – Lloyd George had grown up in Wales and spoke Welsh as his first language – that “it became known as the ‘city of dreadful knights’”, said the magazine. Skip advert The scandal led to the passing of the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act in 1925, and Gregory would eventually become the only person to be convicted under the act, continuing to falsely offer honours to the wealthy and connected into the 1930s. Wilson’s Lavender List Allegedly handwritten on pastel-hued paper by Harold Wilson’s closest aide Marcia Williams, later Lady Falkender, the so-called “Lavender List” has become an infamous document in modern political history. The list named businessmen Wilson had chosen to honour to mark his 1976 resignation, making way for James Callaghan as the next prime minister. The list was controversial as many felt it “sanctioned the ennobling and knighting of crooked and dubious businessmen”, according to The Times – many of whom held views antithetical to the values of the Labour Party. Names included a knighthood for Joseph Kagan, later convicted of false accounting, and businessman Eric Miller, who committed suicide while his firm was being investigated. But further controversy was fuelled by the suggestion that Lady Falkender was either the principal author of the list or had sought to add to the list in order to reward her friends and financially benefit from the list herself. The list was seen as “an indication of the sway she held over Wilson, her alleged lover”, reported the paper. Lady Falkender denied any involvement in compiling the list, maintaining she had “merely copied it from another list, on pink”, said the Financial Times in her 2019 obituary. And in 2007, the BBC was forced to pay her £75,000 in libel damages after a BBC Four docu-drama claimed she had conducted an affair with Wilson and had undue influence over the list. Blair’s ‘cash-for-honours’ scandal In 2006, Tony Blair became the first prime minister to be questioned by police as part of a political corruption inquiry that would drag on for 16 months, and overshadow the last days of his premiership. An investigation was launched after SNP MP Angus MacNeil complained that four wealthy businessmen were nominated by Tony Blair for peerages after lending the party a total of £5m. All four of the peerages were blocked by the House of Lords appointments commission, and MacNeil’s complaint launched a police investigation into whether laws banning the sale of honours had been broken. Skip advert The police inquiries would lead to 136 people being interviewed, according to the BBC, and Blair himself would be questioned three times, although not under caution and “as a witness rather than a suspect”. Labour’s chief fundraiser Lord Levy – nicknamed “Lord Cashpoint” by the tabloid press – was arrested twice on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. In 2007, the police would hand a 216-page report on the scandal to the Crown Prosecution Service – which later announced it had insufficient evidence to bring charges against anyone. Cameron accused of cronyism David Cameron was accused of cronyism when he nominated almost 50 close aides, political allies and Conservative donors for honours as part of his resignation honours list.
