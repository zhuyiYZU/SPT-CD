        {{
        "Reason": According to the facts, electronegativity increases across periods and decreases down groups, and it is stated that fluorine is the most electronegative element. The context also supports this by mentioning that chlorine, which is in the same group as fluorine, has a lower electronegativity due to its larger atomic radius. Therefore, based on the given information, fluorine has the highest electronegativity.
        "Answer": Fluorine
